  abstract = {The Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, a cornerstone in plasma modeling, is widely employed for its ability to simulate kinetic phenomena in device-scale domains. Part of what makes this possible is that computational macroparticles represent many physical particles. It converges under certain constraints, including a grid spacing that resolves the Debye length and a time step small enough to respect the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition and plasma frequency stability limit. Here, we introduce a new constraint necessary to avoid Artificial Correlation Heating (ACH). This requires that the macroparticle coupling strength be smaller than one,  Γw\&lt;1, where  Γw≡Γw2/3,  Γ=Z2e2/(4πεoakBT) is the physical coupling strength, and w is the macroparticle weight. This is particularly relevant to 3D simulations of dense plasmas, which are becoming common with modern computing power. If this condition is violated, the finite macroparticle weight artificially enhances the coupling strength and causes the plasma to heat until the macroparticle coupling strength is near unity, depending on the grid resolution. A comprehensive model of ACH is developed that incorporates electron density, temperature, macroparticle weight, and grid resolution. It is then tested using PIC simulations, delineating the boundaries of the method's applicability and offering a predictive framework for ACH. Moreover, the research explores a runaway heating process induced by ACH in the presence of ionization, which can lead to numerical instability. A conclusion of this study is that the onset of ACH can impose a more stringent constraint on the macroparticle weight and average number of macroparticles per cell than what is typically expected, particularly in 3D simulations of dense plasmas.},

  abstract = {The optimization of scenarios and design of real-time-control in tokamaks, especially for machines still in design phase, requires a comprehensive exploration of solutions to the Grad–Shafranov (GS) equation over a high-dimensional space of plasma and coil parameters. Emulators can bypass the numerical issues in the GS equation, if a large enough library of equilibria is available. We train an ensemble of neural networks to emulate the typical shape-control targets (separatrix at midplane, X-points, divertor strike point, flux expansion, and poloidal beta) as a function of plasma parameters and active coil currents for the range of plasma configurations relevant to spherical tokamaks with a super-X divertor, with percent-level accuracy. This allows a quick calculation of the classical-control shape matrices, potentially allowing real-time calculation at any point in a shot with submillisecond latency. We devise a hyperparameter sampler to select the optimal network architectures and quantify uncertainties on the model predictions. To generate the relevant training set, we devise a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to produce large libraries of forward Grad–Shafranov solutions without the need for user intervention. The algorithm promotes equilibria with desirable properties, while avoiding parameter combinations resulting in problematic profiles or numerical issues in the integration of the GS equation.},

  abstract = {In the initial stages of operation for future tokamak, facing limited data availability, deploying data-driven disruption predictors requires optimal performance with minimal use of new device data. This paper studies the issue of data utilization in data-driven disruption predictor during cross tokamak deployment. Current predictors primarily employ supervised learning methods and require a large number of disruption and non-disruption shots for training. However, the scarcity and high cost of obtaining disruption shots for future tokamaks result in imbalanced training datasets, reducing the performance of supervised learning predictors. To solve this problem, we propose the Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder Anomaly Detection (E-CAAD) predictor. E-CAAD can be trained only by non-disruption samples and can also be trained by disruption precursor samples when disruption shots occur. This model not only overcomes the sample imbalance in supervised learning predictors, but also overcomes the inefficient dataset utilization faced by traditional anomaly detection predictors that cannot use disruption precursor samples for training, making it more suitable for the unpredictable datasets of future tokamaks. Compared to traditional anomaly detection predictors, the E-CAAD predictor performs better in disruption prediction and is deployed faster on new devices. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate the deployment of the E-CAAD predictor on the new device by using data from existing devices. Two deployment strategies are presented: mixing data from existing devices and fine-tuning the predictor trained on existing devices. Our comparisons indicate that the data from existing device can accelerate the deployment of predictor on new device. Notably, the fine-tuning strategy yields the fastest deployment on new device among the designed strategies.},

The dynamics of two-dimensional vortices in an inviscid, ideal fluid continue to be the subject of theoretical investigation in various settings. For instance, in two-dimensional turbulence, merging extended vortices with the same sign of vorticity has been proposed as a key element in the decay of turbulence in 2D flows.21 In this regard, electron systems offer an excellent setting to study vortex merging and turbulence in 2D flows.

The perturbative modes strongly affect particles with specific kinetic characteristics through resonant mode–particle interactions. In this work, we present an analytical calculation of the kinetic q factor, enabling the identification of particles with kinetic properties that meet the resonant conditions. This allows us to predict the locations and structures of the corresponding resonant island chains, as well as the existence of transport barriers in the particle phase space. The analytical results, derived for the case of a large aspect ratio configuration, are systematically compared to numerical simulations, and their domain of validity is thoroughly investigated and explained. Our findings demonstrate that calculating the kinetic q factor and its dependence on both particle and magnetic field characteristics provides a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the resonant plasma response to non-axisymmetric perturbations. Moreover, this approach can be semi-analytically applied to generic realistic experimental equilibria, offering a low-computational-cost method for scenario investigations under various multi-scale perturbative modes.},

The dependence of diffusivity on potential fluctuation amplitude is linear in the SMT regime, and quadratic in the quasilinear regime. The transition to strong microturbulence results from larger E×B drift velocities in the edge compared to the plasma core. At these larger velocities, ions traverse the spatially correlated range faster than the stochastic evolution of the electric potential. Hence, these particles do not experience a time-stochastic field as required by the quasilinear approximation. Instead, scattering of particles in the SMT regime is caused by spatial stochasticity. In contrast, electron energy transport remains quasilinear due to decorrelations caused by collisions and fast parallel motion. Improved understanding of transport beyond quasilinear theory opens the path to more accurate modeling of transport in the tokamak plasma edge.},

  abstract = {The paper presents experimental and modelling results of a comparison of negative (NT) and positive (PT) triangularity ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) discharges using the plasma shapes presently foreseen in the DTT tokamak, under construction in Italy. This work is part of a broader effort of investigation to understand whether the good properties observed in NT scenarios in DIII-D and TCV may be extrapolated to the DTT device and more generally to DEMO future operations. The experimental results have shown a practical gain of running these AUG plasmas with only ECRH and mixed NBI+ECRH phases in negative triangularity, even if they access the H-mode. Indeed, the NT electron kinetic profiles recover in all cases the PT electron pressures inside mid-radius due to reduced transport in the region , while exhibiting lower individual ELM (Edge Localised Mode) energy losses. The ion pressure and expected fusion performance are comparable in the case of similar densities. Integrated modelling has been performed using the transport solver ASTRA and the quasi-linear turbulent model TGLF, investigating the transport properties of these discharges. The modelling reproduces the experiments qualitatively with reasonable accuracy. Nonetheless, the heat transport in NT cases is partially overestimated. This may be because TGLF uses the Miller equilibrium, which approximates the magnetic flux surfaces as up-down symmetric. In the caseof these asymmetric NT shapes, the simulated outer surfaces lose part of the tilt with respect to the z-axis, reducing the upper δ {$<$} 0 effect. A numerical test to discern the impact of the geometry by symmetrically flipping the shape has shown a beneficial effect of the negative triangularity on heat transport.},

  abstract = {The “Generalized Plasma Focus problem” refers to a generic class of plasma propagation phenomena that share many features of a dense plasma focus device. Its recent theoretical development has been shown to predict some features of the pinch phase in PF-1000 and POSEIDON. The theory attempts to decompose the plasma propagation problem into two weakly interdependent subproblems. This is achieved by expressing every physical variable of an applicable continuum model of the plasma as the product of a scaling parameter, which contains device-related information and represents its numerical magnitude, and a scaled variable that is devoid of device-related information, is of order unity, and represents the spatiotemporal structure of that variable. The first subproblem seeks a traveling surface of revolution whose local normal velocity equals the scaling parameter for velocity and is aligned with the magnetic force density. Spatiotemporal distributions of all the scaled variables must move along with this reference surface by definition. This paper explores the resulting scaling theory and its symmetry properties. A new coordinate transformation results in a formula for the spatiotemporal distribution of the magnetic field of the curved and non-steady plasma sheath. New insights into the snowplow effect are obtained. A current sheath with a rear boundary exists only when the current is decreasing and only when the current carrying plasma is less dense than the fill gas. The current sheath thickness is the same for small and large devices. The geomagnetic flux compression problem has an exact solution.},

The Debye regime is characterized by a state where all dust particles carry an equal and constant charge. The high dust density regime or the “Coulomb plasma” regime is characterized by (a) “Coulomb screening” where the dust charge depends on the spatial location and is screened by other dust particles in the vicinity by charge reduction, (b) “asymptotic freedom” where dust particles, which on an average carry minimal electric charge, are asymptotically free in the high dust density limit, (c) uniform dust charge density and plasma potential, (d) dust charge neutralization by a uniform background of hot ions, and (e) dust is weakly coupled due to strong Coulomb screening. Thus, the dusty plasma is essentially a weakly coupled, one-component plasma with screening in the high dust density limit. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations verify these properties. The MD simulations are performed, using a recently proposed Hamiltonian formalism to study the dynamics of Yukawa particles carrying variable electric charge.

The primary strength of this disruption predictor lies in its inherent self-organization capability. Diverging from both supervised disruption predictors and earlier approaches suggested by the same authors, which were based on unsupervised models such as Self-Organizing or Generative Topographic Maps, this predictor eliminates the need for labeling data of disruption terminated pulses during training. In prior methods, labels were indeed required post-mapping to inform the model about the presence or absence of disruption precursors at each time instant during the disrupted discharges. In contrast, our approach in this study involves no labeling of data from disruption-terminated experiments. The Self-Organizing Map, operating without any a priori information, adeptly identifies the regions characterizing the pre-disruptive phase. Moreover, SOM discovers non-trivial relationships and captures the complicated interplay of device diagnostics on the internal plasma states from the experimental data. The provided model is highly interpretable; it allows the visualization of high-dimensional data and facilitates easy interrogation of the model to understand the reasons behind its correlations. Hence, utilizing SOMs across various devices can prove invaluable in extracting rules and identifying common patterns, thereby facilitating extrapolation to ITER of the knowledge acquired from existing tokamaks.},

TCVs flexible shaping capabilities were exploited to extend previous impurity transport studies to negative triangularity (δ {$<$} 0).

  abstract = {In this work, we study the impact of aspect ratio (the ratio of major radius R 0 to minor radius r) on the confinement benefits of negative triangularity (NT) plasma shaping. We use high-fidelity flux tube gyrokinetic GENE simulations and consider several different scenarios: four of them inspired by TCV experimental data, a scenario inspired by DIII-D experimental data and a scenario expected in the new SMART spherical tokamak. The present study reveals a distinct and non-trivial dependence. NT improves confinement at any value of A for ITG turbulence, while for TEM turbulence confinement is improved only in the case of large and conventional aspect ratios. Additionally, through a detailed study of a large aspect ratio case with pure ITG drive, we develop an intuitive physical picture that explains the beneficial effect of NT at large and conventional aspect ratios. This picture does not hold in TEM-dominated regimes, where a complex synergistic effect of many factors is found. Finally, we performed the first linear gyrokinetic simulations of SMART, finding that both NT and PT scenarios are dominated by micro-tearing-mode (MTM) turbulence and that NT is more susceptible to MTMs at tight aspect ratio. However, a regime where ITG dominates can be found in SMART, and in this regime NT is more linearly stable.},

  abstract = {A systematic study has been carried out to obtain the fundamental units of triad interaction in Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Instead of finding the elementary building blocks of nonunique mode-to-mode (M2M) transfer rates, we have investigated the fundamental units for uniquely defined combined transfers and convincingly showed that the mode-to-mode transfers can act as a practical base element for the same. In addition to the conventional field-specific mode-to-mode transfers, here we have introduced the idea of mode-specific transfers, which is found to be important for the turbulent cascade and the turbulent relaxed states. Whereas the Hall transfer is found to associate mode-to-mode transfers for mode-specific interactions (with a three-member basis), it presents a mixture of typical mode-to-mode (also with a three-member basis) and non-mode-to-mode (with a five-member basis) transfers for the field-specific interactions. The non-mode-to-mode transfers are shown to satisfy the triad conservation differently from the mode-to-mode transfers. However, they also possess an inherent non-uniqueness and hence cannot be determined unambiguously unlike the combined transfer rates.},

The effect of neutral interactions and triangularity on plasma blobs is explored due to the impact blobs can have in setting the SOL width or introducing impurities through interactions with plasma-facing components. Seeded blob simulations with neutrals in shaped SOL scenarios demonstrate that increasing elongation, triangularity, or Shafranov shift decreases radial blob velocities, but neutral interactions have a minor effect. Fully turbulent simulations of DIII-D IWL plasmas include both open- and closed-field-line regions. The negative triangularity (NT) simulation has lower average core Te, lower normalized Te fluctuations, and lower fluxes, but a greater number of coherent structures (blobs) identified with increased size and velocity, on average. Density and electron temperature profiles are within a factor of 2 of experimental values. The increased trapped electron particle fraction in NT simulations is consistent with previous studies.},

The differential test-particle component of the operator is exact; the integral field-particle component is approximated using a spherical harmonic and a modified Laguerre polynomial expansion developed by Hirshman and Sigmar (1976 Phys. Fluids 19 1532). The numerical methods of the implementation in the δf-gyrokinetic code (Barnes et al 2019 J. Comput. Phys. 391 365–80) are discussed, and conservation properties of the operator are demonstrated. The collision model is then benchmarked against the collision model of the gyrokinetic solver GS2 in the limiting cases of a reduced test-particle collision operator and energy- and momentum-conserving operator. The accuracy of the full collision model is investigated by solving the parallel Spitzer-Härm problem for the transport coefficients. It is shown that retaining collisional energy flux and higher-order terms in the field-particle operator reduces errors in the transport coefficients from 10\%–25\% for a simple momentum- and energy-conserving model to under 1\%.},

The linear stability index Δ′0, even for positive values, is not enough to describe the trigger of the mode as the stabilizing non-linear effects tend to prevent the growth of a mode below a certain width. First, an analysis on the contribution of the stabilizing effect of the curvature and the destabilizing effect of the bootstrap is done. Second, the work focuses on the role of the ion polarization current, a return current that flows parallel to the magnetic field due to the difference in the drift motion of the electrons and ions. This contribution is thought to play an important role in the onset of an island of width W, because it scales as 1/W3, making it a dominant term in the GRE when W is small. The assessment is carried out over a subset of pulses, producing interesting observations that were then generalized across the entire database, obtaining consistent results.},

Dedicated experiments have been performed with slow steps of increasing electron cyclotron heating power. Gyrokinetic simulations of the edge turbulence of these plasmas highlight the key roles of the non-linear electromagnetic effects and the external flow shear (E\,×\,B shear), both related to the evolution of the plasma pressure profile with increasing heating power. The increase in the plasma βe destabilizes turbulence at low toroidal mode numbers, that, in turn, is strongly suppressed by the external flow shear. This allows the plasma pressure profiles to evolve without a sharp rise in the turbulent fluxes. When all the experimentally measured plasma parameters are consistently included as inputs of the local gyrokinetic simulations, both the experimental electron and ion heat fluxes are quantitatively reproduced on the whole L-mode phase of the selected discharge. Simulations carried out with edge parameters of an ELM-free H-mode phase still show the importance of the mechanisms discussed earlier while also indicating possible limitations of the local approach.},

  abstract = {Tokamak disruptions are associated with breaking magnetic surfaces, which makes magnetic field lines chaotic in large regions of the plasma. The enforcement of quasi-neutrality in a region of chaotic field lines requires an electric potential that has both short and long correlation distances across the magnetic field lines. The short correlation distances produce a Bohm-like diffusion coefficient  ∼Te/eB and the long correlation distances  aT produce a large scale flow  ∼Te/eBaT. This cross-field diffusion and flow are important for sweeping impurities into the core of a disrupting tokamak. The analysis separates the electric field in a plasma into the sum of a divergence-free,  E→B, and a curl-free,  E→q, part, a Helmholtz decomposition. The divergence-free part of  E→ determines the evolution of the magnetic field. The curl-free part enforces quasi-neutrality,  E→q=−∇→Φq. Magnetic helicity evolution gives the required boundary condition for a unique Helmholtz decomposition and an unfortunate constraint on steady-state tokamak maintenance.},

Disparity between minimum safety factor values predicted by magnetic flux diffusion theory and derived from experiment suggests anomalous flux diffusion by an MHD dynamo, driven by flows associated with quasi-interchange modes. Stability calculations with the GATO code find NT and IBS experimental equilibria unstable to quasi-interchange modes, in agreement with observed saturated activity. IBS discharges with similar magnetic winding structure occupy robust helical core states following a transition from sawtooth instabilities.

  abstract = {One of the main objectives of ITER is to produce 500 MW of power from a deuterium-tritium plasma for several seconds. This goal presents two inherent challenges: firstly, in-vessel components will require active cooling to remove the heat coming from the fusion reaction (i.e., mainly fast neutrons and alpha particles). Secondly, the materials exposed to the neutron flux will yield activated corrosion products (ACPs) in all primary cooling circuits of ITER. From a safety point of view, ACPs are one of the contributors to the Occupational Radiation Exposure (ORE), they represent a source of radiological waste and also contribute to the source term for accidental scenarios involving the loss of primary confinement. Therefore, ACPs assessment is key to estimate radiological impact for nuclear workers and the public. ITER nuclear safety engineers adopted OSCAR-Fusion v1.4.a code to assess the ACPs inventory in the Integrated Blanket ELMs and Divertor (IBED) cooling loop. This paper describes the selection of input data, the modelling of the circuits and the operational scenarios used in OSCAR-Fusion calculations. This study also examines the outcomes of such calculations, notably in terms of ACPs inventory, emphasizing the impact on the ORE and highlighting its driving parameters. Additionally, the paper offers recommendations for better ACPs management in the context of the ITER project and in accordance with the ALARA principle.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Large edge localised modes (ELMs) would cause an unacceptable reduction of material lifetime in future large tokamaks due to the significant amount of energy expelled from the magnetically confined region towards the plasma facing components. Thoroughly validated modelling of regimes devoid of large ELMs is crucial as it may then provide predictive insights prior to tokamak operation and design. This paper describes recent efforts pursued with the non-linear extended MHD code JOREK in the modelling of three scenarios without large ELMs: quiescent H-mode (QH-mode), quasi-continuous exhaust regime (QCE regime), and the enhanced D-alpha H-mode (EDA H-mode). For each of these regimes, the non-linear dynamics observed in the simulations are detailed and compared to experimental observations of the underlying instabilities of each regime (edge harmonic oscillation for QH-mode, small ELMs for QCE regime, and quasi-coherent mode for EDA H-mode). For QH-mode, the kink-peeling mode is found to govern the dynamics and a transition to a large ELM is obtained above the same density threshold as in the modelled experiment. For the QCE regime and EDA H-mode, resistive peeling–ballooning modes dominate and pedestal fluctuation frequencies correspond well to experimental observations. The dominant mechanisms for the excitation and suppression of these instabilities are presented and their influence on simulation dynamics is shown. Finally, predictive simulations of edge instabilities at different values of plasma resistivity in a 4.60 MA scenario with low edge safety factor in JT-60SA are presented.},

All the stationary operational boundary plasma studies and reactor designs have been performed under this assumption. However, there has been a long-standing suspicion that a stationary-operation tokamak plasma even without external MPs or edge localized modes (ELMs) activities may not have a stable closed separatrix surface, especially near the magnetic X-point. Here, the first gyrokinetic numerical observation is reported that the divertor separatrix surface, due to homoclinic tangles caused by intrinsic electromagnetic turbulence, is not a stable closed surface in a stationary operation phase even without MPs or ELMs. Unlike the MP- or ELM-driven homoclinic tangles that could cause deleterious effects to core confinement or divertor plates, it is found that the micro-turbulence driven homoclinic tangles could connect the divertor plasma to the pedestal plasma in a constructive way by broadening the divertor heat-exhaust footprint and weakening the pedestal slope to the ELM-safe direction. Micro-turbulent homoclinic tangles can open a new research direction in understanding and controlling these two most troublesome and non-locally connected edge-plasma issues in a tokamak fusion reactor.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the particle weight in a δf particle-in-cell simulation depends on the marker distribution that can evolve in a turbulent field due to turbulent diffusion. When Monte Carlo methods are used to implement the test particle collision operator, or when the particle motion is not strictly Hamiltonian in a collisionless simulation, the marker distribution will evolve along the particle trajectory and, in general, cannot be known exactly. A two-dimensional numerical marker distribution is proposed as an approximation. It is shown to be advantageous over other common methods for evaluating the marker distribution in long-time turbulence simulations. A generalized two-weight δf-method is proposed to mitigate the marker evolution problem.},

This time-varying potential structure, which has axisymmetric characteristics (n = 0) and a finite radial correlation length (less than 1 cm), was identified to be generated by the three-wave interaction in small-scale turbulence. The results illustrate that the amplitude of the LFZF-like structure dramatically increases with the influence of impurity ions, which is mainly due to the increased strength in the nonlinear energy transfer by the turbulence vortex symmetry-breaking process. Consequently, the enhanced LFZF-like structure has the ability to stabilize the local turbulence via the shearing decorrelation mechanism as demonstrated in this experiment. The observed results given here reveal the essential role played by the LFZF-like structure in the reduction of turbulence levels, which could advance our understanding of the multi-scale physics governing turbulence and the resulting transport in magnetically confined plasmas.},

  abstract = {The experimental and theoretical analysis were focused on experiments conducted to assess the effect of plasma isotopes, protium (H), deuterium (D), and tritium (T) on ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) related plasma wall interactions. Comparison of L-mode discharges with N = 1 3He and N = 1 H minority ICRH heating scenarios were done for different isotopes. For the selected pulses, the behaviour of high-Z, mid-Z and low-Z intrinsic impurity and radiated power behaviour was investigated based on data from VUV, visible spectroscopy, and bolometry diagnostic at Joint European Torus. It was found that for N = 1 3He scenario during radiofrequency antennas operation, core W, Ni content, Be source and the radiated power are higher for π/2 in comparison to dipole antenna phasing. Lowest core Ni, W content and radiated power is clearly observed for H plasmas in comparison to D and T, where for this ICRH scenario behaviour was similar. However, lower Be photon flux is observed for T in comparison to D plasmas. Be sputtering by He particles is responsible for such an effect. Additionally, several computer simulations were conducted using the COREDIV code. The difference in the electron temperature was due to the difference in the isotope masses. Increased temperature in the central plasma in the case of T plasmas leads to higher radiation in the central plasma in comparison to H plasmas. As a result, the power across separatrix is lower and the temperature on the divertor plate decreases with the increase of the isotope mass. At these temperatures on the divertor plate, W is not sputtered by the main plasma ions H, D and T and by He. For the N = 1 H ICRH scenario clear difference between D and T plasma was observed with higher metallic impurity content for T plasma in comparison to D. Impurity content in the plasmas is found to be sensitive to the power balance between the antenna straps. Its minimum is observed for the maximum of P cen/P tot.},

  abstract = {Magnetically confined fusion plasmas are subject to various instabilities that cause turbulent transport of particles and heat across the magnetic field. In the edge plasma region, this transport takes the form of long filaments stretched along the magnetic field lines. Understanding the dynamics of these filaments, referred to as blobs, is crucial for predicting and controlling their impact on reactor performance. To achieve this, highly resolved passive fast camera measurements have been conducted on the COMPASS tokamak. These measurements are analyzed using both conventional tracking methods and a custom-developed machine-learning approach designed to characterize more particularly the mutual interactions between filaments. Our findings demonstrate that up to 18\% of blobs exhibit mutual interactions in the investigated area close to the separatrix, at the border between confined and nonconfined plasma. Notably, we present direct observations and radial dependence of blob coalescence and splitting, rapid reversals in the propagation direction of the blob, as well as their dependence on the radial position. The comparison between observations realized with passive and gas puff imaging does not evidence any significant bias due to the use of the latter technique.},

These modes are driven by the density gradient in trapped electron population but with mode frequency in the ion diamagnetic drift direction, in contrast to the conventional trapped electron mode. The dispersion relation is calculated along with the global mode structure. The ubiquitous mode is quite global although appears at a shorter wavelength (). We show that the main driving mechanism is the density gradient and the temperature gradient has only a modest effect; the mode can persist at higher temperature gradient scenarios making it another possible channel of anomalous transport. The magnetic shear reduces the growth of the mode; while the electron to ion temperature ratio has a nonmonotonic effect on the mode growth rate—growth rate increases initially for the ubiquitous branch of the mode and decreases afterwards as the conventional trapped electron mode starts dominating. The role of safety factor and toroidicity is also analyzed. Finally, a mixing length-based estimation of transport is presented.},

These NT plasmas also have a stable edge that inhibits H-mode, lacks dangerous edge transients, and has naturally low impurity confinement. For these reasons, NT plasmas have the potential to be a transformative reactor scenario. To determine the importance of strong co-current neutral beam torque for NT performance at DIII-D, scans of neutral beam torque at constant neutral beam power have been performed. These scans have shown that the energy confinement time for a basic, inductive NT scenario () decreases by 16\% when torque is reduced to reactor levels. This reduction in confinement can be replicated with gyrofluid modeling that isolates the role of shear in the change in transport. In a separate set of discharges with lower plasma current (), no significant correlation between confinement time and rotation was found. Throughout this investigation, excellent MHD stability was observed, even with very low toroidal rotation. Further, low impurity confinement was found at multiple rotation levels. Throughout the campaign, rotation near the edge was counter-current, consistent with the measurement of counter-current intrinsic edge rotation, and these observations agree with NT results from the TCV tokamak.},

These modes comprise a broad class of instabilities, encompassing interchange modes and kink modes, with both short and long length scales. Toroidal effects and fully electromagnetic fields are of crucial importance for their description. The role of resistive diffusion and compressibility are also critical. In order to investigate this awkward problem while still enabling fundamental physics interpretation, a new resistive MHD eigensolver has been developed. An outcome of this study is the identification of an unstable spectrum of resistive infernal modes in regions of the plasma with weak average curvature, and in regions where the average curvature is destabilising. These fast growing modes may be collectively important for our understanding of global reconnection events, stochastic magnetic fields states, and neighbouring supercritical bifurcations.},

In I-mode, only toroidal rotation asymmetries have been measured while in L-mode no asymmetries have been observed. The measured parallel flow can be divided in two components, the Pfirsch–Schlüter (PS) flow and the symmetric flow. Two different methods have been followed to determine both contributions to the parallel flow. The first method is based on the calculation of the PS flow at the HFS and LFS from the radial electric field. The second method directly provides the symmetric flow from the flux surface average (FSA) of the parallel flow. In H-mode, the methods provide different results, while in L-mode and I-mode they agree. The differences observed in H-mode between the two methods could be explained by the existence of asymmetries in the impurity density, by the non-negligible particle sources and radial losses, or by the approximations made in the calculation of the FSA of the parallel flow from measurements in two poloidal positions (midplane HFS and LFS) only.},

  abstract = {Understanding the transport mechanisms that regulate the H-mode pedestal structure is crucial for developing regimes with edge dynamics that are compatible with the thermal and particle load constraints of plasma facing components. In this regard, at the JET tokamak, H-mode plasma regimes featuring small-ELM (BSE) dynamics have been developed, expelling less plasma energy per ELM compared to the standard type-I ELM. The pedestal of these new regimes remains stable against peeling-ballooning modes, leaving its structure unexplained. In this study, three baseline H-mode JET discharges—a reference with type-I ELM and two BSE regimes—are selected to investigate the turbulent transport mechanisms occurring in pedestals with different structures. The turbulence analysis is conducted using local gyrokinetic simulations around the pedestal top position. The results show that at ion scales, while hybrid ITG-KBM and KBM are destabilized in the type-I ELM discharge, the BSE regimes are dominated by hybrid ITG-TEM, suggesting a different role of turbulent transport in the two cases. At electron scales, both regimes are dominated by toroidal and slab ETG, the latter extending up to very small scales. Simulations of turbulence driven by hybrid ITG-TEM focuses on the impact and competition of electromagnetic (EM) effects and equilibrium shearing. A strong EM stabilization mechanism is found, resulting in a saturated turbulence regime with spectra different from those in the electrostatic limit (ESl). Additionally, while increasing shearing reduces transport in ESl simulations, it is observed to have the opposite effect in the EM regime. Finally, stiff ETG transport is also shown to produce transport levels compatible with experimental observations. The findings of this study suggest the EM stabilization and its competition with shearing as new key elements that determine the nature of the turbulent transport mechanisms around the pedestal top, which need to be considered in reduced models for pedestal limits.},

Furthermore, during the feedback control process of multi-pulse supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI), the stored energy changes from 29 kJ to 58 kJ, and the energy confinement factor (H 89) increases from 0.98 to 1.45, implying a positive effect of coupling feedback on plasma performance. Experiments between SMBI puffing and the gas puffing system, fed by a piezoelectric valve near the antenna, are further investigated, showing that the response time of the RC with SMBI is faster than that by the piezoelectric valve. In addition, SMBI puffing on the electron-drift side of the LHW antenna is a little quicker than that on the ion-drift side. Studies suggest that such feedback control is effective for long-pulse LHW–plasma coupling, and the gas puffing by SMBI on the electron-drift side of the LHW antenna could offer an effective way to sustain good LHW coupling in steady-state operation in the future. Further optimization will be continued at a later date.},

Two micro-tearing branches growing near the surfaces of safety factor q\,=\,4 (pedestal top) and q=5–6 (pedestal) are simulated. The frequencies of these MTMs with low toroidal mode number (n ranging from 3 to 6) are in agreement with the ones of quasi-coherent fluctuations present on the magnetic spectrogram. No kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) is observed at experimental values of β; instead, the experimental plasma lies 20\% below the critical global KBM threshold. This confirms local simulation results stating that experimental NSTX profiles lie in the KBM stability region. Carbon impurities, which are abundant in this plasma, were found to play a significant role. Neglecting them leads to a ∼50\% error in the growth rates.},

We report the first measurements of drift-Alfvén wave polarization in a hot, magnetically confined plasma. The breakthrough is enabled by a novel methodology developed from gyrokinetic theory, utilizing fluctuations of electron temperature and density. Analysis of data from the DIII-D tokamak reveals that the waves above the geodesic acoustic mode frequency exhibit dominant electromagnetic polarization, whereas lower-frequency waves show a mix of electromagnetic and electrostatic polarization, indicating a strong coupling between shear Alfvén waves and drift-acoustic waves.},

  abstract = {A quasilinear plasma transport theory that incorporates Fokker-Planck dynamical friction (drag) and pitch angle scattering is self-consistently derived from first principles for an isolated, marginally unstable mode resonating with an energetic minority species. It is found that drag fundamentally changes the structure of the wave-particle resonance, breaking its symmetry and leading to the shifting and splitting of resonance lines. In contrast, scattering broadens the resonance in a symmetric fashion. Comparison with fully nonlinear simulations shows that the proposed quasilinear system preserves the exact instability saturation amplitude and the corresponding particle redistribution of the fully nonlinear theory. Even in situations in which drag leads to a relatively small resonance shift, it still underpins major changes in the redistribution of resonant particles. This novel influence of drag is equally important in plasmas and gravitational systems. In fusion plasmas, the effects are especially pronounced for fast-ion-driven instabilities in tokamaks with low aspect ratio or negative triangularity, as evidenced by past observations. The same theory directly maps to the resonant dynamics of the rotating galactic bar and massive bodies in its orbit, providing new techniques for analyzing galactic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Tokamak à configuration variable (TCV), recently celebrating 30 years of near-continual operation, continues in its missions to advance outstanding key physics and operational scenario issues for ITER and the design of future power plants such as DEMO. The main machine heating systems and operational changes are first described. Then follow five sections: plasma scenarios. ITER Base-Line (IBL) discharges, triangularity studies together with X3 heating and N2 seeding. Edge localised mode suppression, with a high radiation region near the X-point is reported with N2 injection with and without divertor baffles in a snowflake configuration. Negative triangularity (NT) discharges attained record, albeit transient, βN ∼ 3 with lower turbulence, higher low-Z impurity transport, vertical stability and density limits and core transport better than the IBL. Positive triangularity L-Mode linear and saturated ohmic confinement confinement saturation, often-correlated with intrinsic toroidal rotation reversals, was probed for D, H and He working gases. H-mode confinement and pedestal studies were extended to low collisionality with electron cyclotron heating obtaining steady state electron iternal transport barrier with neutral beam heating (NBH), and NBH driven H-mode configurations with off-axis co-electron cyclotron current drive. Fast particle physics. The physics of disruptions, runaway electrons and fast ions (FIs) was developed using near-full current conversion at disruption with recombination thresholds characterised for impurity species (Ne, Ar, Kr). Different flushing gases (D2, H2) and pathways to trigger a benign disruption were explored. The 55 kV NBH II generated a rich Alfvénic spectrum modulating the FI fas ion loss detector signal. NT configurations showed less toroidal Alfvén excitation activity preferentially affecting higher FI pitch angles. Scrape-off layer and edge physics. gas puff imaging systems characterised turbulent plasma ejection for several advanced divertor configurations, including NT. Combined diagnostic array divertor state analysis in detachment conditions was compared to modelling revealing an importance for molecular processes. Divertor physics. Internal gas baffles diversified to include shorter/longer structures on the high and/or low field side to probe compressive efficiency. Divertor studies concentrated upon mitigating target power, facilitating detachment and increasing the radiated power fraction employing alternative divertor geometries, optimised X-point radiator regimes and long-legged configurations. Smaller-than-expected improvements with total flux expansion were better modelled when including parallel flows. Peak outer target heat flux reduction was achieved ({$>$}50\%) for high flux-expansion geometries, maintaining core performance (H98 {$>$} 1). A reduction in target heat loads and facilitated detachment access at lower core densities is reported. Real-time control. TCV’s real-time control upgrades employed MIMO gas injector control of stable, robust, partial detachment and plasma β feedback control avoiding neoclassical tearing modes with plasma confinement changes. Machine-learning enhancements include trajectory tracking disruption proximity and avoidance as well as a first-of-its-kind reinforcement learning-based controller for the plasma equilibrium trained entirely on a free-boundary simulator. Finally, a short description of TCV’s immediate future plans will be given.},

Fusion 33, 1533 (1993)], the Grad-Shafranov equation for an axisymmetric tokamak plasma equilibrium is solved via an expansion in the, supposedly small, inverse aspect-ratio of the plasma, ϵ. The displacements of equilibrium magnetic flux-surfaces due to plasma shaping are assumed to be  O(ϵ) smaller than the minor radii of the surfaces, but no other restriction is placed on the nature of the shaping. The solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation is matched to a vacuum solution that extends to infinity, and consists of an expansion in toroidal functions. The external poloidal magnetic field generated by a finite set of discrete external poloidal magnetic field-coils is calculated, and incorporated into the toroidal function expansion. In this manner, the shape of a large aspect-ratio tokamak plasma is directly related to the currents flowing in the external poloidal field-coils. Finally, a pedestal in the plasma pressure, and the associated spike in the bootstrap current, are incorporated into the model.},

Namely, visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of NSTX-U and DIII-D plasmas showed the onset of bifurcations with new magnetic isochronous islands for two competing helical perturbations on the same rational magnetic surface. To investigate these bifurcations, we use a cylindrical plasma model, with first-order correction for toroidicity, subject to externally applied magnetic perturbations, generated by a pair of resonant helical windings (RHWs) on the external wall and superposed to a helical current sheet (HCS) located on a rational plasma surface. We numerically integrate the magnetic field line equation and show that isochronous islands emerge when the perturbation created by the HCS increases. We present examples of such bifurcations on primary and secondary magnetic surfaces for different RHW configurations.},

Perturbations to the core plasma can be reduced by a factor of 2 for equivalent edge stability proxies, while the perturbed plasma boundary geometry remains mostly resilient. The striated domain of perturbed field lines connecting from the main plasma (normalized poloidal flux ) to the divertor targets is found to be significantly larger than the expected heat load width in the absence of RMPs. This facilitates heat load spreading with peak values at an acceptable level below on the outer target already at moderate gas fueling and low Ne seeding for additional radiative dissipation of the of power into the scrape-off layer (SOL). On the inner target, however, re-attachment is predicted away from the equilibrium strike point due to increased upstream heat flux, higher downstream temperature and less efficient impurity radiation.},

  abstract = {Quantitative spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen has generated substantial demand, leading to the accumulation of diverse elementary process data encompassing radiative transitions, electron-impact transitions, predissociations, and quenching. However, their rates currently available are still sparse, and there are inconsistencies among those proposed by different authors. In this study, we demonstrate an experimental validation of such a molecular dataset by composing a collisional-radiative model (CRM) for molecular hydrogen and comparing experimentally obtained vibronic populations across multiple levels. From the population kinetics of molecular hydrogen, the importance of each elementary process in various parameter space is studied. In low-density plasmas (electron density  ne≲1017\,m−3) the excitation rates from the ground states and radiative decay rates, both of which have been reported previously, determine the excited state population. The inconsistency in the excitation rates affects the population distribution the most significantly in this parameter space. However, in higher density plasmas ( ne≳1018\,m−3), the excitation rates from excited states become important, which have never been reported in the literature, and may need to be approximated in some way. In order to validate these molecular datasets and approximated rates, we carried out experimental observations for two different hydrogen plasmas; a low-density radio frequency heated plasma ( ne≈1016\,m−3) and the Large Helical Device (LHD) divertor plasma ( ne≳1018\,m−3). The visible emission lines from  EF1Σg+,\,HH¯1Σg+,\,D1Πu±,\,GK1Σg+,\,I1Πg±,\,J1Δg±,  h3Σg+,\,e3Σu+,\,d3Πu±,g3Σg+,\,i3Πg±, and  j3Δg± states were observed simultaneously and their population distributions were obtained from their intensities. We compared the observed population distributions with the CRM prediction, in particular the CRM with the rates compiled by Janev et al., Miles et al., and those calculated with the molecular convergent close-coupling (MCCC) method. The MCCC prediction gives the best agreement with the experiment, particularly for the emission from the low-density plasma. However, the population distribution in the LHD divertor shows a worse agreement with the CRM than those from low-density plasma, indicating the necessity of the precise excitation rates from excited states. We also found that the rates for the electron attachment is inconsistent with experimental results. This requires further investigation.},

As is known from Maxwellian as well as (standard) kappa plasmas, the respective Fried–Conte and the modified plasma dispersion functions are valuable tools for various analytical studies. For the latter it has been proven very useful to know about the mathematical properties, as analytical continuation, series expansions as well as asymptotic expressions. Given the growing popularity of the regularized kappa distribution, as indicated by its increasing number of applications to various problems related to suprathermal plasmas, we extend its theoretical treatment here by providing the corresponding plasma dispersion function along with various properties.},

Although there are many similarities in the overall flow dynamics, three key differences between the kinetic and fluid simulations are identified. Magnetic reconnection is more efficient, and rapidly accelerates a nonthermal particle population, in our kinetic approach. In addition, the plasma in the kinetic simulations develops significant departures from thermal equilibrium, including pressure anisotropy that excites kinetic-scale instabilities, and a large field-aligned heat flux near the horizon that approaches the free-streaming value. We discuss the implications of our results for modeling event-horizon scale observations of Sgr A* and M87 by GRAVITY and the Event Horizon Telescope.},

  abstract = {A reduced model for trapped electron mode stability has been developed, which incorporates the basic effects of magnetic surface shaping, in particular, elongation and triangularity. This model shows that while elongation is stabilising, though weakly, negative triangularity usually leads to a more unstable plasma. This is in marked contrast with the experimental evidence of a better confinement at negative triangularity, and with recent gyrokinetic linear simulations. This paradox is solved when finite orbit and/or finite mode extent along field lines (mode ballooning) effects are included. These effects give more weight to particles trapped at low bounce angles, which are those that exhibit lower precession frequencies at negative—compared to positive—triangularity. As a result, the interchange growth rate becomes lower at negative triangularity and large temperature gradients, so that negative triangularity appears to have an overall stabilising effect. Mode ballooning appears to play the most important role in this reversal of stability.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explore the triangularity effects on turbulent transport employing global gyrokinetic simulations performed with the ORB5 code. Numerous experiments on the Tokamak á Configuration Variable (TCV) and, more recently, on the DIII-D machine, have demonstrated superior confinement properties in L-mode of negative triangularity (NT) over positive triangularity (PT) configuration. This presents a particularly attractive scenario, as L-mode operation eliminates or significantly mitigates the presence of hazardous edge-localized modes (ELMs). However, a full theoretical understanding of all these observations remains elusive. Specifically, questions remain about how NT improvements can extend to the core where triangularity is very small, and whether these improvements can scale to larger devices. This paper addresses these two questions. Our analysis is divided into two parts: we first demonstrate that the confinement enhancement in NT configurations arises from the interdependent edge-core dynamics, and then we present the results of a system size scan. Crucially, we find that the relative turbulent transport reduction of NT over PT appears not to be contingent on machine dimensions or fluctuation scales and is moreover robust with respect to variations in plasma profiles. This insight underscores the fundamental nature of the NT confinement advantage and paves the way for its potential application in future fusion devices, regardless of their size.},

This issue can be mitigated by one of the most deleterious collective phenomena—the instability of low, sub-cyclotron frequency Alfvén eigenmodes (AEs), such as toroidicity-induced AEs and reversed-shear AEs in the ITER steady-state scenario. Using a revised quasi-linear (QL) theory applied to energetic particle (EP) relaxation in the presence of AEs, we find that the AE instabilities can affect both neutral beam ions and alpha particles, although the resulting fast ion transport is expected to be modest if classical particle slowing down is assumed. On the other hand, the QL theory predicts that the AE amplitudes will be enhanced by the background microturbulence, although this topic remains outside our scope due to the significant numerical effort required to evaluate these effects. We report our results for EP relaxation dynamics obtained utilizing several tools: (i) a comprehensive linear stability study of the sub-cyclotron Alfvénic spectrum as computed by ideal magnetohydrodynamic NOVA simulations for the AE eigenproblem, (ii) drift kinetic NOVA-C calculations for wave–particle interaction and AE growth/damping rates, and (iii) predictive QL modeling coupled with the global transport code TRANSP to assess the EP relaxation on the equilibrium timescale.},

The investigation is focused on the evaluation of the plasma triangularity (δ) impact on the impurity radiation in hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), tritium (T), and deuterium–tritium (DT) plasmas for pulses described in [P. A. Schneider, Nucl. Fusion 63, 112010 (2023)]. The variations of δ were in the range of 0.21–0.31 for different time windows with low magnetic toroidal field (    B t = 1.7\,T) and plasma current (    I p = 1.4\,MA) in the corner–corner configuration, that is with both the inner and outer strike points on the horizontal W-coated divertor target plates. The results confirm the rise in Be flux with plasma isotope and lower δ leading to higher plasma density close to the plasma wall. The dominant role of W as a source of plasma radiation has also been confirmed. For mid-Z impurities and W, the variations in their densities due to δ change are negligible and the rise in their densities is observed with higher isotope mass, although this effect is often masked by the dominant role of ELM frequency on the impurity level. The impurity radiation losses based on bolometry together with the W intensity are ruled by the changes in the electron density and are well correlated when the Te profiles are conserved.},

  abstract = {In the ITER and future fusion devices, W/Cu monoblocks will be used as divertor target which are exposed to both steady state heat load and transient heat flux. Especially, the transient heat flux up to 10 GW m−2 during plasma disruption, is expected to induce the shallow surface damages, such as melting, and even boiling of W/Cu monoblocks. Thus, the performance of damaged W/Cu monoblocks under subsequent long-term plasma discharges is a key concern that needs to be verified and tested on existing tokamaks. Since 2022, a new type of main limiter composed of ITER-like W/Cu monoblocks has been installed and tested in EAST. The surface of W/Cu monoblocks of the limiter was damaged by the transient heat flux during the early stages of plasma construction. Subsequently, they were subjected to long-term plasma discharges over 2600 shots in normal plasma discharge conditions. This circumstance conveniently facilitates the discussion of the performance of W/Cu monoblocks with damaged surfaces especially a melting edge with hill structure under prolonged exposure to plasma. In general, the shallow damage resulting from transient heat flux on W/Cu monoblocks appears to have minimal impact on the heat exhaust capacity under steady-state heat loads, as indicated by both experimental monitoring and numerical simulation results. However, shallow melting, leading to a change in surface structure and the formation of hills, could theoretically increase local temperatures, creating potential hot spots. This phenomenon requires further validation through dedicated experiments. Moreover, the brittleness of the near-surface layer may give rise to brittle destructions, such as cracks and even dust particles, posing an additional concern. These findings yield unique qualitative conclusions that can be referenced for ITER and other fusion devices.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on the refinement (building on (Hatch D.R. et al 2022 Phys. Plasmas 29 062501)) and application of simple formulas for electron heat transport from electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven turbulence in the pedestal. The formulas are improved by (1) improving the parameterization for certain key parameters and (2) carefully accounting for the impact of geometry and shaping in the underlying gyrokinetic simulation database. Comparisons with nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of ETG transport in the MAST pedestal demonstrate the model’s applicability to spherical tokamaks in addition to standard aspect ratio tokamaks. We identify bounds for model applicability: the model is accurate in the steep gradient region, where the ETG turbulence is largely slab-like, but accuracy decreases as the temperature gradient becomes weaker in the pedestal top. We use the formula to model the electron temperature profile in the pedestal for four experimental scenarios while extensively varying input parameters to represent uncertainties. In all cases, the predicted electron temperature profile exhibits extreme sensitivity to separatrix temperature and density, which has implications for core-edge integration. The model reproduces the electron temperature profile for high scenarios but not for low η e scenarios in which microtearing modes (MTMs) have been identified. We develop a proof-of-concept model for MTM transport and explore the relative roles of ETG and MTM in setting the electron temperature profile.},

  abstract = {During the operation of tokamak devices, addressing the thermal load issues caused by edge localized modes (ELMs) eruption is crucial. Ideally, mitigation and suppression measures for ELMs should be promptly initiated as soon as the first low-to-high confinement (L-H) transition occurs, which necessitates the real-time monitoring and accurate identification of the L-H transition process. Motivated by this, and by recent deep learning boom, we propose a deep learning-based L-H transition identification algorithm on HL-2A tokamak. In this work, we have constructed a neural network comprising layers of Residual long short-term memory and temporal convolutional network. Unlike previous work based on recognition for ELMs by slice, this method implements recognition on L-H transition process before the first ELMs crash. Therefore the mitigation techniques can be triggered in time to suppress the initial ELMs bursts. In order to further explain the effectiveness of the algorithm, we developed a series of evaluation indicators by shots, and the results show that this algorithm can provide necessary reference for the mitigation and suppression system.},

By utilizing both 1D plasma profiles (current density, pressure gradient, and safety factor) and 0D parameters (plasma geometry, total current, and toroidal mode number), the model predicts linear growth rate of edge-localized ideal MHD instability in a given equilibrium state. By enabling the prediction of each instability within a second, the model reduces the time required for plotting a pedestal P–B stability diagram ( diagram) from approximately 100 CPU hours to a few CPU minutes. Notably, even with the utilization of parametric pressure and current profiles and plasma boundary shapes for the training dataset, the model shows a satisfactory level of performance in benchmarking the diagram for the reconstructed equilibrium from a KSTAR tokamak experiment. We anticipate the model to serve as a versatile alternative to 2D linear MHD stability codes, alleviating numerical costs.},

Measurements from Doppler back-scattering and a thermal helium beam diagnostic are used to determine velocities of the background plasma and the WCM over multiple discharges. A phase velocity of the WCM of the order of 2–5 km s−1 in the electron diamagnetic drift direction is found, quantitatively close to a drift wave assuming negligible temperature fluctuations. A good agreement with a previously proposed mechanism behind the I-mode regime is observed. This marks the first experimental verification of a specific understanding of the WCM and the I-mode regime.},

  abstract = {The DIII-D tokamak has elucidated crucial physics and developed projectable solutions for ITER and fusion power plants in the key areas of core performance, boundary heat and particle transport, and integrated scenario operation, with closing the core-edge integration knowledge gap being the overarching mission. New experimental validation of high-fidelity, multi-channel, non-linear gyrokinetic turbulent transport models for ITER provides strong confidence it will achieve Q ⩾ 10 operation. Experiments identify options for easing H-mode access in hydrogen, and give new insight into the isotopic dependence of transport and confinement. Analysis of 2,1 islands in unoptimized low-torque IBS demonstration discharges suggests their onset time occurs randomly in the constant β phase, most often triggered by non-linear 3-wave coupling, thus identifying an NTM seeding mechanism to avoid. Pure deuterium SPI for disruption mitigation is shown to provide favorable slow cooling, but poor core assimilation, suggesting paths for improved SPI on ITER. At the boundary, measured neutral density and ionization source fluxes are strongly poloidally asymmetric, implying a 2D treatment is needed to model pedestal fuelling. Detailed measurements of pedestal and SOL quantities and impurity charge state radiation in detached divertors has validated edge fluid modelling and new self-consistent ‘pedestal-to-divertor’ integrated modeling that can be used to optimize reactors. New feedback adaptive ELM control minimizes confinement reduction, and RMP ELM suppression with sustained high core performance was obtained for the first time with the outer strike point in a W-coated, compact and unpumped small-angle slot divertor. Advances have been made in integrated operational scenarios for ITER and power plants. Wide pedestal intrinsically ELM-free QH-modes are produced with more reactor-relevant conditions, Low torque IBS with W-equivalent radiators can exhibit predator-prey oscillations in T e and radiation which need control. High-β P scenarios with q min {$>$} 2, q 95–7.9, β N {$>$} 4, β T–3.3\% and H 98y2 {$>$} 1.5 are sustained with high density ( = 7E19 m−3, f G–1) for 6 τ E, improving confidence in steady-state tokamak reactors. Diverted NT plasmas achieve high core performance with a non-ELMing edge, offering a possible highly attractive core-edge integration solution for reactors.},

  abstract = {A record duration of a 310 s H-mode plasma (H98y2 ∼ 1.3, ne/nGW ∼ 0.7, fBS \&gt; 50\%) has been recently achieved on experimental advanced superconducting tokamak (EAST) with metal walls, exploiting the device's improved long-pulse capabilities. The experiment demonstrates good control of tungsten concentration, core/edge MHD stability, and particle and heat exhaust with an ITER-like tungsten divertor and zero injected torque, establishing a milestone on the path to steady-state long-pulse high-performance scenarios in support of ITER and CFETR. Important synergistic effects are leveraged toward this result, which relies purely on radio frequency (RF) powers for heating and current drive (H\&CD). On-axis electron cyclotron heating enhances the H\&CD efficiency from lower hybrid wave injection, increasing confinement quality and enabling fully non-inductive operation at high density (ne/nGW ∼ 70\%) and high poloidal beta (βP ∼ 2.5). A small-amplitude grassy edge localized mode regime facilitates the RF power coupling to the H-mode edge and reduces divertor sputtering/erosion. The high energy confinement quality (H98y2 ∼ 1.3) is achieved with the experimental and simulated results pointing to the strong effect of Shafranov shift on turbulence. Transport analysis suggests that trapped electron modes dominate in the core region during the record discharge. The detailed physics processes (RF synergy, core-edge integration, confinement properties, etc.) of the steady-state operation will be illustrated in the content. In the future, EAST will aim at accessing more relevant dimensionless parameters to develop long-pulse high-performance plasma toward ITER and CFETR steady-state advanced operation.},

The excellent energy confinement quality (H 98y2 ∼ 1.8) is achieved with an internal transport barrier at high line-averaged Greenwald density fraction f Gr {$>$} 0.9. The trapped gyro-Landau fluid (TGLF) modeling of the transport characteristics shows that the beam-driven rotation does not play an important role in the high confinement quality. The modeling also captures very well several transport features, giving us confidence in using integrated modeling to project these experimental results to future machines. The high-performance phase is terminated by fast-growing modes triggered near the n = 1 ideal-wall kink stability limit. New radio frequency (RF) capabilities for off-axis current drive could remove the residual ohmic current to achieve a fully non-inductive state, and improve the mode–wall coupling to increase the ideal-wall β N limit, enabling sustainment of the fully non-inductive high performance plasma in stationary conditions.},

Model plasma parameters are chosen based on hydrogen isotope pellet experiments on JET, in which fast hydrogen isotope mixing in the timescale of the energy confinement time  τE occurred after injecting deuterium (D) pellets into hydrogen (H) plasmas. Two numerical experiments are conducted using plasma profiles before and after the pellet injection. In both cases, turbulent fluctuations in the plasma core are characterized by ion temperature gradient driven turbulence. In the former case, the density profile of bulk H ions is kept in a quasi-steady state, and the particle confinement time of bulk H ions  τH is an order of magnitude longer than  τE. In the latter case, the density profiles of bulk H ions and pellet D ions show transient relaxation in the timescale of  τE, and both  τH and the timescale of particle pinch  τD become comparable to  τE, indicating the fast hydrogen isotope mixing. In the toroidal angular momentum balance, it is found that the enhanced ion particle transport leading to the fast hydrogen isotope mixing is driven by the toroidal field stress.},

It is found that ITG/TEM turbulence can drive ion particle pinch by E × B drift (n ≠ 0) when the ion temperature gradient is steep enough. Electron particle pinch is also driven by E × B drift (n ≠ 0) in the case with the steep electron temperature gradient. Such an electron particle pinch can trigger an ambipolar electric field, leading to additional ion particle pinch by not only magnetic drift but also E × B drift (n = 0). These results suggest that a density peaking of bulk ions due to turbulent fluctuations can be achieved by sufficiently strong both ion and electron heating.},

  abstract = {A higher plasma β is desirable for realizing high performance fusion reactor, in fact, one of the three goals of JT-60SA project is to achieve a high-β regime. We investigate key physical processes that regulate the β dependence of turbulent transport in L-mode plasmas by means of both local and global gyrokinetic simulations. From local simulations, we found that the turbulent transport does not decrease as β increases, because the electromagnetic stabilizing effect is canceled out by the increase of the Shafranov shift. This influence of the Shafranov shift is suppressed when the magnetic shear is weak, and thus the electromagnetic stabilization is prominent in weak shear plasmas, suggesting an advantage of weak magnetic shear plasmas for achieving a high-β regime. In high β regime, local gyrokinetic simulations are suffered from the non-saturation of turbulence level. In global simulations, by contrast, the electromagnetic turbulence gets saturated by the entropy advection in the radial direction to avoid the zonal flow erosion due to magnetic fluctuations. This breakthrough enables us to explore turbulent transport at a higher β regime by gyrokinetic simulations.},

  abstract = {The JET-ILW pure tritium and deuterium–tritium (DTE2) experimental campaigns took place in 2021–2022. Tritium (T) and deuterium–tritium (D–T) operations present challenges not encountered in present day tokamaks (Horton et al 2016 Fusion Eng. Des. 109–111 925–36). This contribution focuses on ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) operations in tritium and deuterium–tritium plasmas, starting with a summary of the program of improvements to the ICRH system which spanned a few years prior to these experiments. Procedures were implemented to address specific constraints from tritium and deuterium–tritium operations (tritium safety and reduced access to the RF generator area) and increase the system reliability and power availability during plasma pulses. Operation of the upgraded real time RF power control system that maximises the launched power while taking into account limitations from the system or antenna coupling is described. We also report on the result from dedicated pulses performed to assess the potential harmful impact of the 2nd harmonic tritium resonance in the plasma, close to the inner wall, when using the standard central hydrogen minority ICRH scheme. During DTE2, the ITER-like antenna was not used because water leaked from an in-vessel capacitor into the vessel on day-2 of the experimental campaign. The lessons learnt from this incident are highlighted. Finally, the ICRH plant adjustments required to safely perform ion cyclotron wall cleaning discharges are described.},

  abstract = {A large number of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium calculations are often required for uncertainty quantification, optimization, and real-time diagnostic information, making MHD equilibrium codes vital to the field of plasma physics. In this paper, we explore a method for solving the Grad–Shafranov equation by using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). For PINNs, we optimize neural networks by directly minimizing the residual of the partial differential equation as a loss function. We show that PINNs can accurately and effectively solve the Grad–Shafranov equation with several different boundary conditions, making it more flexible than traditional solvers. This method is flexible as it does not require any mesh and basis choice, thereby streamlining the computational process. We also explore the parameter space by varying the size of the model, the learning rate, and boundary conditions to map various tradeoffs such as between reconstruction error and computational speed. Additionally, we introduce a parameterized PINN framework, expanding the input space to include variables such as pressure, aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity in order to handle a broader range of plasma scenarios within a single network. Parameterized PINNs could be used in future work to solve inverse problems such as shape optimization.},

GMEC\_I solves multi-level reduced-MHD models that form a hierarchy of physics complexity, which provide conveniences for the cross-code verification and the identification of key physics effect in tokamak geometry. The field-aligned coordinates are used to represent mode structure efficiently. High-order finite difference methods are used for spatial discretization. The shifted metric methods are used for numerical stability. The discrete expansion forms of physics equations in the code are generated symbolically using the compile-time symbolic solver, which is specifically developed to reduce the complexity of the high-order finite difference form of the MHD equations. Advanced computational techniques have been implemented for optimizing memory access and code parallelization that show a good efficiency using both thread building block and message passing interface. Benchmarks between GMEC\_I and the eigenvalue code MAS are presented for ballooning modes without and with diamagnetic drift effects, and tearing modes, which show excellent agreements.},

A significant quantity of tritium would be produced in TBM, and partly released into the port cell from the pipework of TBS or other high-temperature components due to its strong mobility and high permeation. The port cell should be accessible during equipment maintenance and human intervention. This work built a multi-dimensional geometric model to characterize HTO transport in the port cell, absorption/desorption, and diffusion in walls and discussed the effect of paint thickness, ventilation rate, source term, and epoxy properties on detritiation efficiency. The results suggest that a 0.1–0.16 mm paint with the lowest HTO solubility is optimal from the compromise between quick cleanup and tritiated waste decommission. A higher ventilation rate could accelerate detritiation while minimizing the radioactive source by a tritium-resisting layer is the most direct method. The optimized design options for reducing the time required to reach 1 DAC in 12 h still need further discussion because of the delayed HTO source from epoxy paint and dead zone of the flow field.},

  abstract = {Uncovering the mechanisms of physics is driving a new paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI) discovery. Today, physics has enabled us to understand the AI paradigm in a wide range of matter, energy, and space-time scales through data, knowledge, priors, and laws. At the same time, the AI paradigm also draws on and introduces the knowledge and laws of physics to promote its own development. Then this new paradigm of using physical science to inspire AI is the physical science of artificial intelligence (PhysicsScience4AI, PS4AI). Although AI has become the driving force for development in various fields, there is still a “black box” phenomenon that is difficult to explain in the field of AI deep learning. This article will briefly review the connection between relevant physics disciplines (classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical physics, quantum mechanics) and AI. It will focus on discussing the mechanisms of physics disciplines and how they inspire the AI deep learning paradigm, and briefly introduce some related work on how AI solves physics problems. PS4AI is a new research field. At the end of the article, we summarize the challenges facing the new physics-inspired AI paradigm and look forward to the next generation of artificial intelligence technology. This article aims to provide a brief review of research related to physics-inspired AI deep algorithms and to stimulate future research and exploration by elucidating recent advances in physics.},

Ionic transport properties are generated from implicit electron pair matched molecular dynamics simulations, bypassing the need for either dynamical electron simulations or on-the-fly electronic structure calculations. These matched pair potentials are generated in a nonlinear way using a classical mapping procedure, further avoiding an expensive force-matching procedure. We compare these results with the density functional theory data presented at the workshop, as well as a set of widely used parametric models, which we have modified to enhance accuracy, especially at the low- and high-temperature extremes of the parameter space. We also detail the non-trivial statistical aspect of converging ionic transport coefficients.},

Although the effect of turbulent energy exchange has not been considered significant in previous studies, it is anticipated to have a greater impact than collisional energy exchange in low collisional plasmas such as those in future fusion reactors. In this study, gyrokinetic simulations are performed to evaluate the energy exchange due to ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence in a tokamak configuration. The energy exchange due to the ITG turbulence mainly consists of the cooling of ions in the    ∇ B-curvature drift motion and the heating of electrons streaming along a field line. It is found that the ITG turbulence transfers energy from ions to electrons regardless of whether the ions or electrons are hotter, which is in marked contrast to the energy transfer by Coulomb collisions. This implies that the ITG turbulence should be suppressed from the viewpoint of sustaining the high ion temperature required for fusion reactions since it prevents energy transfer from alpha-heated electrons to ions as well as enhancing ion heat transport toward the outside of the reactor. Furthermore, linear and nonlinear simulation analyses confirm the feasibility of quasilinear modeling for predicting the turbulent energy exchange in addition to the particle and heat fluxes.},

It is shown that the L-H transition can then be initiated from an inner edge near the ITG-RBM transition point with a finite width. Especially, this width is found to have a strong edge safety-factor or poloidal field dependence, similar to that shown by the EPED1 model. Meanwhile, unlike the pedestal width, the H-mode threshold power appears to be much less sensitive to the edge safety-factor, in qualitative agreement with the observed weak dependence of the threshold power on plasma current (IP). From an additional brief check, these dependences on IP are also found to be quite different from the behavior of other parameters (ion mass, toroidal field, plasma density, and effective Z-number) where the threshold power depends relatively strongly while the initial width depends somewhat weakly on most of them, except the effective Z-number.},

On the other hand, the electron and ion heat avalanches measured in JT-60U tend to spread from the local peak of the temperature gradient and are not influenced by the heating source profiles. The contrasting features of avalanches in stellarator/heliotrons and tokamaks potentially imply the difference in the temperature profile formation, such as the presence of stiffness.},

Our starting point is based on what we have learned and will continue to learn from publicly funded research on STs. Keeping prototype ST devices and HTS magnets small has enabled rapid innovation toward a commercial goal. Our ST40 compact, high field ST has proven exceptional performance, with plasma ion temperatures over 100 × 106 °C (above 8\,keV) and a record triple product for any private company (n T τE ∼\,1019\,keV\,s/m3). Meanwhile, our robust, compact, quench-safe, HTS magnets can routinely achieve over 24\,T. We now have results of great interest to fusion scientists, so as well as pursuing our commercial goals, we are contributing to scientific progress in fusion. Opportunities to participate in public–private partnerships are emerging with Tokamak Energy already selected for the U.S. Department of Energy milestone program and well-positioned to participate in the U.K. Government Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production program. Other countries are likely to adopt similar approaches as the need for rapid development of fusion energy becomes ever more apparent.},

The self-heating of thermonuclear fusion plasma by alpha particles was observed in recent deuterium-tritium (D−T) experiments on the joint European torus. This observation was possible by conducting so-called “afterglow” experiments where transient high fusion yield was achieved with neutral beam injection as the only external heating source, and then termination of the heating at peak performance. This allowed the first direct evidence for electron heating of plasmas by fusion-born alphas to be obtained. Interpretive transport modeling of the relevant D−T and reference deuterium discharges is consistent with the alpha particle heating observation.},

  abstract = {Using a global gyrofluid code, we conduct comprehensive flux-driven simulations incorporating external heat and momentum sources/sinks. They involve an external torque ramp while keeping a heating power constant. Simulations show the formation of internal transport barriers (ITBs) in ion heat and parallel momentum in weak magnetic shear configuration. The ITB formation is attributed to the reduction of turbulent transport accompanied by strong flow shear generation, where the majority of shear arises from plasma rotation shear. In contrast, only a minor confinement improvement is observed in strong magnetic shear configuration. There exists a substantial difference in the rotation shear between the weak and strong magnetic shear cases at the same amount of external torque. Transport analysis implies that the difference comes from intrinsic rotation generated by residual stress. Global linear simulations demonstrate that the effect of shear on symmetry breaking is enhanced in weak magnetic shear configuration, explaining the origin of the difference in intrinsic rotation. The ITB is not achieved when the external torque is injected in counter-direction to intrinsic rotation. It is also shown that threshold torque for the ITB formation depends on power and the ratio of external torque to heating power should exceed a critical value to attain an ITB.},

This leads to two problems. The first is to understand the mapping between the allowed class of rearrangements and the possible outcomes that these rearrangements can have on the overall distribution. The second is to understand which rules are appropriate for which physical systems. There has been recent progress on both fronts, but a variety of interesting questions remain unanswered.},

  abstract = {In this study, within the framework of electron magnetohydrodynamics, taking into account thermomagnetic phenomena, we obtained a new large-scale instability of the  α-effect type, which ensures the generation of large-scale vortex and magnetic fields. This instability occurs in a flat layer of temperature-stratified plasma under the influence of an external uniform magnetic field inclined relative to the layer, combined with a small-scale external force having zero helicity. The external force is presented as a source of small-scale oscillations in the speed of electrons with a low Reynolds number  R≪1. The presence of a small parameter in the system allowed us to apply the method of multiscale asymptotic expansions to derive nonlinear equations for vortex and magnetic disturbances. These equations were obtained in third-order Reynolds number. Using solutions for the velocity field in zero order in Reynolds number, we determined the average helicity  H=v0·rotv0¯ and its relation to the  α-effect. A necessary condition for the generation of average helicity in stratified magnetized plasma is the inclined orientation of the external magnetic field and the presence of a small-scale force. A new effect related to the influence of thermal force (the Nernst effect) on large-scale instability is discussed. It is shown that an increase in the Nernst parameter leads to a decrease in the amplification factor  α and thereby prevents the development of large-scale instability. With the help of numerical analysis, stationary solutions to the vortex and magnetic dynamo equations in the form of localized structures like nonlinear waves of the Beltrami were obtained.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of heavy impurities in the tokamak core is detrimental for its performance and can lead to disruption of the plasma. In small to medium-sized tokamaks the effective neoclassical transport in the pedestal is typically oriented radially inward. In larger tokamaks—e.g., ITER—where the temperature gradient is higher and density gradients are lower due to the need to operate in a radiative divertor regime, the neoclassical transport is predicted to be outwards. The models are derived for axisymmetric quasi-steady-state plasmas. Applied 3D magnetic fields, i.e., Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMPs) as they are used to suppress Edge Localized Modes (ELMs), have experimentally been observed in AUG to enhance the outflow of heavy impurities in the pedestal. There is no model that can predict neoclassical heavy impurity transport in these ergodized 3D magnetic fields self-consistently. In this contribution, we present our kinetic tungsten transport simulation for an ASDEX Upgrade plasma with applied RMPs. Our model based on Hoelzl et al. [Nucl. Fusion 61, 065001 (2021)], van Vugt et al. [Phys. Plasmas 26, 042508 (2019)], and Korving et al. [Phys. Plasmas 30, 042509 (2023)] utilizes a full-orbit pusher, ionization, recombination, effective line, and continuum radiation and neoclassical collisions with the background plasma. The effective collisional radiative rates are from the OpenADAS database, the neoclassical collision operator uses the framework of Homma et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 250, 206–223 (2013)] and Homma et al. [Nucl. Fusion 56, 036009 (2016)]. We show that the adopted collision operator produces neoclassical transport within a satisfactory degree of accuracy. A sufficiently high RMP current causes an increase in tungsten diffusion in the pedestal by a factor of 2. We compare the average radial transport between axisymmetric and 3D RMP scenarios in the pedestal region. RMPs enhance the pedestal permeability for impurities, which results in enhanced transport. In addition to the enhanced transport, some of W is found to be trapped in 3D potential wells in the scrape-off layer. Due to the lack of suitable diagnostics for W in the pedestal, we investigate and suggest that argon can be an adequate substitute in experiments for model validation and further understanding impurity transport in scenarios with applied 3D magnetic fields. With the newly developed neutral model [Korving et al., Phys. Plasmas 30, 042509 (2023)], we can combine the interaction in the divertor with the 3D RMPs to model the tungsten transport from the divertor toward the core of the plasma.},

In particular, it is shown that impurities can significantly facilitate an abrupt transient increase of fluctuation amplitude. To demonstrate this, a fluid model is derived to describe how impurities enter fluctuation dynamics. At the linear level, a wave similar to a drift wave can be excited in the presence of impurities. The nonlinear dynamics of this wave is formulated via modulational analysis, and it is demonstrated that drift waves with impurities can develop into a breather, a nonlinear wave that exhibits transient increase of amplitude. Our model indicates that nonlinear breathers become easier to be excited as impurity concentration increases. Breathers transiently increase fluctuation amplitude, and hence may be important to expel impurities. Implications on basic experiments and magnetic fusion are discussed as well.},

This mechanism, then, broadens the class of configurations (in magnetized plasmas) where these high confinement states can be formed and sustained. The need for velocity shear, the conventional agent for TB formation, is obviated. The most important ramifications of the constraint is to permit a charting out of the domains conducive to TB formation and hence to optimally confined fusion worthy states; the detailed investigation is conducted through new analytic methods and extensive gyrokinetic simulations.},

By introducing the “associated” enstrophy, it is shown that with no FLR effects (where anomalous transport of all ion species is described as a transport of passive scalars in the turbulent fields of the electrostatic potential and electron density fluctuations) the fluctuating densities of ion species converge to the state where they are linearly proportional to electron density and vorticity fluctuations, which confirm previous numerical findings of [A. R. Knyazev and S. I. Krasheninnikov, Phys. Plasmas 31, 012502 (2024)]. However, in contrast to the “cold” ion approximation, with the FLR effects included, both the plasma turbulence and the dynamics of all ion species become interconnected. Therefore, for simplicity, the FLR effects in this work were considered only for a small “trace” impurity fraction. It is found that for light (neon) “trace” impurity, the FLR effects reduce both anomalous flux and density fluctuations. However, for heavy (tungsten) “trace” impurity, the FLR effects exhibit non-monotonic impact on anomalous transport.},

Plasmas 17, 074502 (2010)] on a direct method for finding similarity reductions of partial differential equations such as the Grad–Shafranov equation, to the case of the generalized Grad–Shafranov equation (GGSE) with arbitrary incompressible flow. Several families of analytic solutions are constructed, the generalized Solovév solution being a particular case, which contain both the classical and non-classical group-invariant solutions to the GGSE.

  abstract = {Abstract                            In this paper we report on the implementation and verification of a phase-space resolved energetic particle (EP) transport model. It is based on a first-principle theoretical framework, i.e. the system of non-linear gyrokinetic equations and the related transport equations. Its focus is primarily directed toward understanding the meso-scale character of EPs and its consequences. Compared to the conventional description of thermal radial transport via a one-dimensional radial diffusion equation, the newly developed model is three-dimensional using canonical constants-of-motion (CoM) variables. The model does not assume diffusive processes to be dominant               a priori               , instead the EP fluxes are self-consistently calculated and directly evolved in CoM space. We use the EP-Stability workflow and the HAGIS code to determine the phase space fluxes explicitly either in the limit of constant mode amplitudes or an energy-conserving quasi-linear model. As an application of the model the transport of neutral-beam-generated EPs due to a toroidal Alfvén eigenmode in an ITER plasma is investigated. As there are no sources and collisions taken into account so far (for an extension of the model see the companion paper (Meng               et al               2024               Nucl.

  abstract = {We describe a new method for solving the linearized 1D Vlasov–Poisson system by using properties of Cauchy-type integrals. Our method remedies critical flaws of the two standard methods, reveals a previously unrecognized Gaussian-in-time-like decay, and can also account for an externally applied electric field. The Landau approximation involves deforming the Bromwich contour around the poles closest to the real axis due to the analytically continued dielectric function, finding the long-time behavior for a stable system: Landau damping. Jackson's generalization encircles all poles while sending the contour to infinity, assuming its contribution vanishes, which is not true in general. This gives incorrect solutions for physically reasonable configurations and can exhibit pathological behavior, of which we show examples. The van Kampen method expresses the solution for a stable equilibrium as a continuous superposition of waves, resulting in an opaque integral. Case's generalization includes unstable systems and predicts a decaying discrete mode for each growing discrete mode, an apparent contradiction to both the Jackson solution and ours. We show, without imposing additional constraints, that the decaying modes are never present in the time evolution due to an exact cancellation with part of the continuum. Our solution is free of integral expressions, is obtained using algebra and Laurent series expansions, does not rely on analytic continuations, and results in a correct asymptotically convergent form in the case of infinite sums. The analysis used can be readily applied in higher-dimensional, electromagnetic systems and also provides a new technique for evaluating certain inverse Laplace transforms.},

Reconnection has been suggested to play an important role in the energetics and dynamics of turbulence by observations, simulations, and theory for two decades. The fundamental properties of reconnection at kinetic scales, essential to understanding the general problem of reconnection in magnetized turbulence, remain largely unknown at present. Here, we present an application of the magnetic flux transport method that can accurately identify reconnection in turbulence to a three-dimensional simulation. Contrary to ideas that reconnection in turbulence would be patchy and unpredictable, highly extended reconnection X lines, on the same order of magnitude as the system size, form at kinetic scales. Extended X lines develop through bidirectional reconnection spreading. They satisfy critical balance characteristic of turbulence, which predicts the X-line extent at a given scale. These results present a picture of fundamentally extended reconnection in kinetic-scale turbulence.},

  abstract = {The influence of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) on the dynamics of turbulence and flows at the edge of the HL-2A tokamak is analyzed utilizing transfer entropy technique. The results have shown that the RMP damps the poloidal flows as well as the E\,×\,B shearing rate, whereas enhances the toroidal flows and leads to a broadened particle spectrum with increased small scale turbulence transport. The causality analysis indicates that the regulation impact of poloidal flow on turbulent fluctuations and particle flux is weakened, while that of the toroidal rotation on the latter is strengthened by the RMP field. The impact of the changes in poloidal flow dominates over that of the modified toroidal flow on turbulent transport in the edge. The magnetic perturbation and the flows generally show predator–prey oscillations, where the causal effect between the former and the toroidal flow transits to a synchronization relation in the presence of RMP. In addition, the RMP field will weaken the causal effect on poloidal Reynolds stress while strengthening the parallel-radial component simultaneously. The present findings provide a possible explanation on the effects of external fields on the edge transport, which is suggested to be dominated by the complex interactions among external perturbations, flows, and ambient microturbulence.},

However, fundamental questions regarding how PDI is excited in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) open system and how the finite perpendicular wave scale—as found in both laboratory and space plasmas—affects the excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first 3D, open-boundary, hybrid kinetic-fluid simulations of kinetic Alfvén wave PDI in low-beta plasmas. Key findings are that the PDI excitation is strongly limited by the wave damping present, including electron–ion collisional damping (represented by a constant resistivity) and geometrical attenuation associated with the finite-scale Alfvén wave, and ion Landau damping of the child acoustic wave. The perpendicular wave scale alone, however, plays no discernible role: waves of different perpendicular scales exhibit similar instability excitation as long as the magnitude of the parallel ponderomotive force remains unchanged. These findings are corroborated by theoretical analysis and estimates. This new understanding of 3D kinetic Alfvén wave PDI physics is essential for laboratory study of the basic plasma process and may also aid future evaluation of the relevance/role of PDI in low-beta space plasma.},

  abstract = {Limit-cycle oscillations are studied for ion temperature gradient turbulence, which, in the absence of large diamagnetic (mean) shear flows, saturates through energy transfer from unstable modes to large-scale stable modes via zonal-flow intermediary modes. Oscillations of zonal flow and turbulence levels are strongly constrained by the reactive, largely non-dissipative character of the zonal flows. Since existing predator–prey models for observed oscillations in experiments do not include energy transfer through zonal flows to stable modes, low-order fluid models with this physics are constructed and investigated. A simple three-wave truncation produces low-amplitude zonal flows that slowly oscillate around a zero mean, with turbulence oscillations between coupled wavenumbers that exceed linear frequencies by orders of magnitude. This inconsistency with experimental observations is caused by the weak non-linear drive of zonal flows in three-wave systems and the lack of multiple-wavenumber turbulent interactions. A more comprehensive model that preserves multiple wavenumber interactions within the context of conservative zonal-flow-mediated energy transfer to stable modes accurately reflects observed dynamics when the phase between stable and unstable modes is occasionally randomized.},

However, unusually large  ρi/a and low density plasmas are chosen to maximize the nonlocal effect to investigate the finite ρi effect and to be clearly away from kinetic ballooning modes. Similar conclusions to previous flux tube and global simulations have been obtained in this highly nonlocal model plasma: it is essential to include kinetic electrons in the micro-instability study of negative triangularity plasmas. Most physics findings agree with existing reports, with some disagreement. We offer a new “effective trapping fraction” concept that can add to the explanation of the growth rate difference between NT and PT plasmas, pointing to the significant variation in trapped particle fractions that have turning points in the mode growth regions.},

  abstract = {Alfvénic modes in the current quench (CQ) stage of the tokamak disruption have been observed in experiments. In DIII-D the excitation of these modes is associated with the presence of high-energy runaway electrons (REs), and a strong mode excitation is often associated with the failure of RE plateau formation. In this work we present results of self-consistent kinetic-MHD simulations of RE-driven compressional Alfvén eigenmodes (CAEs) in DIII-D disruption scenarios, providing an explanation of the CQ modes. Simulation results reveal that high energy trapped REs can have resonance with the Alfvén mode through their toroidal precession motion, and the resonance frequency is proportional to the energy of REs. The mode frequencies and their relationship with the RE energy are consistent with experimental observations. The perturbed magnetic fields from the modes can lead to spatial diffusion of REs including the nonresonant passing ones, thus providing the theoretical basis for a potential approach for RE mitigation.},

In simulations focusing only on the ITG, electrostatic ITG drives a huge thermal ion heat transport, which is reduced by a factor of to a level close to the experimental value in electromagnetic simulation due to finite effect. In the simulations coupling the RSAE and ITG, ITG can scatter the resonant EP nonlinearly trapped by the RSAE and damp the zonal flows generated by the RSAE. The regulation of the RSAE by the ITG greatly reduces the initial saturation amplitude of the RSAE but increases the RSAE amplitude and associated EP transport to experimental levels in the quasi-steady state. The RSAE effects on the ITG, specifically the stronger zonal flows generated by the RSAE and the RSAE frequency modulation of the ITG-induced thermal ion heat transport, in turn, leads to a reduction of the thermal ion heat transport by more than a factor of . For a stronger background ITG, the regulation of the RSAE by the ITG is stronger, while the RSAE effects on the ITG are weaker.

  abstract = {ENN Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (ENN) is committed to generating fusion energy in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner, which requires abundant aneutronic fuel. Proton-boron (p-11B or p-B) fusion is considered an ideal choice for this purpose. Recent studies have suggested that p-B fusion, although challenging, is feasible based on new cross section data, provided that a hot ion mode and high wall reflection can be achieved to reduce electron radiation loss. The high beta and good confinement of the spherical torus (ST) make it an ideal candidate for p-B fusion. By utilizing the new spherical torus energy confinement scaling law, a reactor with a major radius  R0=4 m, central magnetic field  B0=6 T, central temperature  Ti0=150 keV, plasma current  Ip=30 MA, and hot ion mode  Ti/Te=4 can yield p-B fusion with  Q\&gt;10. A roadmap for p-B fusion has been developed, with the next-generation device named EHL-2. EHL stands for ENN He-Long, which literally means “peaceful Chinese Loong.” The main target parameters include  R0≃1.05 m,  A≃1.85,  B0≃3 T,  Ti0≃30 keV,  Ip≃3 MA, and  Ti/Te≥2. The existing ST device EXL-50 was simultaneously upgraded to provide experimental support for the new roadmap, involving the installation and upgrading of the central solenoid, vacuum chamber, and magnetic systems. The construction of the upgraded ST fusion device, EXL-50U, was completed at the end of 2023, and it achieved its first plasma in January 2024. The construction of EHL-2 is estimated to be completed by 2026.},

During the transition from the L-mode to I-mode, the line-averaged density remains nearly unchanged while a significant change is observed in the electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals at the boundary. The difference between the signals for the two channels at the edge increased, coinciding with the appearance of the WCM and a simultaneous rise in the boundary electron temperature. Further investigation unveiled the modulating role of edge temperature ring oscillation (ETRO) (Liu et al 2020 Nucl. Fusion 60 126016) on high-frequency density fluctuations. Statistical results unveil an inverse relationship between the centeral frequency of the WCM and q 95. Simulation results provide additional insights, demonstrating that the simulated ‘WCM’ in the density fluctuations aligns with experimental data in terms of center frequency. Additionally, the radial distribution of the simulated ‘WCM’ closely corresponds to regions with the strongest electron temperature gradients. Finally, through a cross-correlation analysis of the simulated fluctuations, the following phase relationship for the wavenumber range of ‘WCM’ was observed: .},

To reduce the computational resources of modeling, W ions are treated using the bundled charge state model. The results show that the W erosion flux of He plasma is almost a factor of two higher than that of D plasma under the same upstream electron density and heating power due to the higher W sputtering yield in He plasma. Moreover, the W self-sputtering flux is significantly higher than the W flux sputtered by the main ions. The leakage and retention of W impurities in the divertor region is also analyzed. W ions mainly escape from the near scrape-off layer (SOL) region through the divertor entrance as the stagnation point of the average W impurity poloidal velocity is considerably closer to the target plates in the near SOL region. Furthermore, the leakage flux of W ions in He plasma is higher than that in D plasma, mainly because of the higher W sputtering level in He plasma, which results in a larger W density. W ions with low-lying charge states, mostly comprising the charge state of W10–12+, easily escape from the divertor through the near SOL flux tubes in both D and He plasmas. In addition, the effects of upstream electron density on W sputtering and retention in He and D plasma discharges are presented.},

These studies demonstrate the relation of turbulence spreading and entrainment to intermittent convective density fluctuation events or bursts (i.e. blobs and holes). The non-diffusive character of turbulence spreading is thus elucidated. The turbulence spreading velocity (or mean jet velocity) manifests a linear correlation with the skewness of density fluctuations, and increases with the auto-correlation time of density fluctuations. Turbulence spreading by positive density fluctuations is outward, while spreading by negative density fluctuations is inward. The degree of symmetry breaking between outward propagating blobs and inward propagating holes increases with the amplitude of density fluctuations. Thus, blob-hole asymmetry emerges as crucial to turbulence spreading. These results highlight the important role of intermittent convective events in conveying the spreading of turbulence, and constitute a fundamental challenge to existing diffusive models of spreading.},

  abstract = {This work presents a method for predicting plasma equilibria in tokamak fusion experiments and reactors. The approach involves representing the plasma current as a linear combination of basis functions using principal component analysis of plasma toroidal current densities ( Jt) from the EFIT-AI equilibrium database. Then utilizing EFIT's Green's function tables, basis functions are created for the poloidal flux ( ψ) and diagnostics generated from the toroidal current ( Jt). Similar to the idea of a physics-informed neural network (NN), this physically enforces consistency between  ψ,  Jt, and the synthetic diagnostics. First, the predictive capability of a least squares technique to minimize the error on the synthetic diagnostics is employed. The results show that the method achieves high accuracy in predicting  ψ and moderate accuracy in predicting  Jt with median  R2\,=\,0.9993 and  R2\,=\,0.978, respectively. A comprehensive NN using a network architecture search is also employed to predict the coefficients of the basis functions. The NN demonstrates significantly better performance compared to the least squares method with median  R2\,=\,0.9997 and 0.9916 for  Jt and  ψ, respectively. The robustness of the method is evaluated by handling missing or incorrect data through the least squares filling of missing data, which shows that the NN prediction remains strong even with a reduced number of diagnostics.

  abstract = {This paper investigates the predictive capabilities of TGYRO and TGLF models in assessing the performance of negative triangularity (NT) plasmas compared to positive triangularity (PT) plasmas in fusion devices. TGYRO predicts kinetic profiles, while TGLF analyzes turbulent transport. The study reveals that TGYRO reasonably predicts NT profiles similar to PT, although it overpredicts the high-power scenarios where there is increased experimental MHD activity. TGLF analysis finds reduced linear growth rates in NT and altered flux spectra relative to PT. Additionally, the TGLF SAT0 saturation model is observed to predict high-k transport and a reduction of particle transport with the electron temperature gradient. These findings are further corroborated by core-pedestal modeling using the Stability Transport Equilibrium Pedestal workflow, showing stronger confinement improvements in NT, particularly at higher power densities for the SAT0 saturation model. The study underscores the importance of accurately capturing turbulence saturation mechanisms for NT in order to project its performance accurately in fusion reactors.},

  abstract = {A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is used to evaluate the fast ion distribution in the hot spot of an inertial confinement fusion target. The use of tailored input and output layers to the neural network is shown to enable a PINN to learn the parametric solution to the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck equation in the absence of any synthetic or experimental data. As an explicit demonstration of the approach, the specific problem of Knudsen layer fusion yield reduction is treated. Here, the predictions from the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck PINN are used to provide a non-perturbative solution of the fast ion tail in the vicinity of the hot spot, thus allowing the spatial profile of the fusion reactivity to be evaluated for a range of collisionalities and hot spot conditions. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions of the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck PINN and the results from traditional numerical solvers with respect to both the energy and spatial distribution of fast ions and the fusion reactivity profile, demonstrating that the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck PINN provides an accurate and efficient means of determining the impact of Knudsen layer yield reduction across a broad range of plasma conditions.},

Tungsten (W) transport simulations are performed using the impurity transport code developed in the integrated code TASK. The geometric factors PA and PB are introduced into the neoclassical transport coefficients to include the effects of the toroidal rotation, which come from poloidal asymmetry in the high-Z impurity profiles. Inward neoclassical particle pinch driven by the main ion density gradient is enhanced by the poloidal asymmetry to be the dominant mechanism for W accumulation in the plasma central region. Simulations with experimental plasma profiles show good agreement with the experimental results and first-principle simulation results in the H-mode. In the hybrid mode and advanced mode, the impurity accumulation is enhanced in the internal transport barrier (ITB) regions. The condition to suppress impurity accumulation is investigated by calculating dependencies on the toroidal rotation velocity and ITB position. The neoclassical transport is sufficiently small with the prospected ITER condition of the Mach number of main ions Mi ∼ 0.1. The impurity transport inside the ITB is strongly influenced by competition between the density peaking effect and the temperature screening effect, and the present simulations show suppression of the impurity accumulation with the outer ITB position to improve the plasma performance, due to the relatively larger temperature gradient of the main ion.},

Both methods are applied to the magnetic geometry of the DIII-D tokamak, as well as the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarators, in the absence of temperature gradients. Here we analytically investigate the influence of collisions on the TEM eigenmode frequency by a perturbative approach in the response of trapped particles to the mode, using an energy-dependent Krook operator to model collisions. Although the resulting growth rates exceed perturbative thresholds, they reveal important qualitative dependencies: a geometry-dependent stabilization rate occurs for all wavenumbers at high collisionality, while at low collisionality, a geometry-sensitive mixture of collisionless, resonantly driven, and collisionally destabilized modes is found. Additionally, linear gyrokinetic simulations have been performed with a rigorous pitch-angle scattering operator for the same geometries. In the case of DIII-D and large wavenumber modes in HSX, the trends predicted by analytical theory are reproduced. Dissimilarities are, however, obtained in W7-X geometry and for low wavenumber modes in HSX, which are shown to be due to a collision-induced transition to the Universal Instability as the dominant instability at marginal collisionality.},

Experiments were conducted under similar background plasma conditions and the results showed that variations in pellet deposition depths led to differences in density profiles despite comparable core fueling efficiencies. By computing the effective particle transport coefficients immediately after the pellet injection, it is found that the differences in density profiles are mainly due to significantly different transport velocities in the inner region of ρ {$<$} 0.4. The potential influence of pellets on electrostatic turbulence in this region is investigated using the trapped gyro Landau fluid model and laser collective scattering diagnostics. The simulation suggests that the increase in transport coefficients following pellet injection is attributed to the destabilization of lower-k modes rather than the higher-k modes within the diagnostic measurement range.},

  abstract = {We consider a nearly collisionless plasma consisting of a species of “test particles” in one spatial and one velocity dimension, stirred by an externally imposed stochastic electric field—a kinetic analog of the Kraichnan model of passive advection. The mean effect on the particle distribution function is turbulent diffusion in velocity space—known as stochastic heating. Accompanying this heating is the generation of fine-scale structure in the distribution function, which we characterize with the collisionless (Casimir) invariant 𝐶2∝∫∫⁢𝑑⁢𝑥⁢𝑑⁢𝑣⁡⟨𝑓2⟩—a quantity that here plays the role of (negative) entropy of the distribution function. We find that 𝐶2 is transferred from large scales to small scales in both position and velocity space via a phase-space cascade enabled by both particle streaming and nonlinear interactions between particles and the stochastic electric field. We compute the steady-state fluxes and spectrum of 𝐶2 in Fourier space, with 𝑘 and 𝑠 denoting spatial and velocity wave numbers, respectively. In our model, the nonlinearity in the evolution equation for the spectrum turns into a fractional Laplacian operator in 𝑘 space, leading to anomalous diffusion. Whereas even the linear phase mixing alone would lead to a constant flux of 𝐶2 to high 𝑠 (towards the collisional dissipation range) at every 𝑘, the nonlinearity accelerates this cascade by intertwining velocity and position space so that the flux of 𝐶2 is to both high 𝑘 and high 𝑠 simultaneously. Integrating over velocity (spatial) wave numbers, the 𝑘-space (𝑠-space) flux of 𝐶2 is constant down to a dissipation length (velocity) scale that tends to zero as the collision frequency does, even though the rate of collisional dissipation remains finite. The resulting spectrum in the inertial range is a self-similar function in the (𝑘,𝑠) plane, with power-law asymptotics at large 𝑘 and 𝑠. Our model is fully analytically solvable, but the asymptotic scalings of the spectrum can also be found via a simple phenomenological theory whose key assumption is that the cascade is governed by a “critical balance” in phase space between the linear and nonlinear timescales. We argue that stochastic heating is made irreversible by this entropy cascade and that, while collisional dissipation accessed via phase mixing occurs only at small spatial scales rather than at every scale as it would in a linear system, the cascade makes phase mixing even more effective overall in the nonlinear regime than in the linear one.},

  abstract = {Tokamak plasmas with strong negative triangularity (NT) shaping typically exhibit fundamentally different edge behavior than conventional L-mode or H-mode plasmas. On DIII-D, every plasma with sufficiently negative triangularity () is found to be inherently free of edge localized modes (ELMs), even at injected powers well above the predicted L-H power threshold. It is also possible to access an ELM-free state at weaker average triangularities, provided that at least one of the two x-points is still sufficiently negative. Access to the ELM-free NT scenario is found to coincide with the closure of the second stability region for infinite-n ballooning modes, suggesting that ballooning stability may play a role in limiting the accessible pressure gradient in NT plasmas. Despite this, NT plasmas are able to support small pedestals and are typically characterized by an enhancement of edge pressure gradients beyond those found in traditional L-mode plasmas. Furthermore, the pressure gradient inside of this small pedestal is unusually steep, allowing access to high core performance that is competitive with other ELM-free regimes previously achieved on DIII-D. Since ELM-free operation in NT is linked directly to the magnetic geometry, NT fusion pilot plants are predicted to maintain advantageous edge conditions even in burning plasma regimes, potentially eliminating reactor core-integration issues caused by ELMs.},

  abstract = {A plasma scenario with negative triangularity (NT) shaping is achieved on MAST-U for the first time. While edge localized modes (ELMs) are eventually suppressed as the triangularity is decreased below , an extended period of H-mode operation with Type-III ELMs is sustained at less negative δ even through access to the second stability region for ideal ballooning modes is closed. This documents a qualitative difference from the ELM-free access conditions documented in NT scenarios on conventional aspect ratio machines. The electron temperature at the pedestal top drops across the transition to ELM-free operation, but a steady rise in core temperature as δ is decreased allows for similar normalized β in the ELM-free NT and H-mode positive triangularity shapes.},

  abstract = {Electron and impurity ion density profiles have been controlled by using tangential and perpendicular neutral beams for plasma heating in a stellarator/heliotron for the first time. Reduced anisotropy of stored energy for energetic ion En⊥/Enǁ has resulted in an inward electron and impurity transport, forming a core electron density peaking. Increased anisotropy leads to a flat or hollowed electron density profile with an impurity exhaust in a core region [Yoshinuma et al., Nucl. Fusion 49, 062002 (2009)]. A high confinement state of particles in LHD has yet to be achieved, except for a temporal state of an electron density peaking created by a pellet injection. As a pioneering and crucial research result, the operation of energetic ion anisotropy by neutral beams has newly demonstrated that the direction of the radial transport of bulk and impurity ions can be controlled. At the same time, the overall plasma performance rises in neutron flux and stored energy. On the other hand, the increase in the anisotropy flattens the density profile. This new finding holds promise for a control knob of nuclear fusion reactors to enhance fusion power output.},

  abstract = {This work presents the results following the first irradiation of ITER materials samples in a tokamak D–T plasma environment operating at significant fusion power. The materials exposed to this nuclear environment at the Joint European Torus during the DTE2 experimental campaign that took place in 2021 include representative ITER samples from various components such as poloidal field coil jacket samples, toroidal field coil radial closure plate steels, EUROFER 97 steel, W and CuCrZr materials from the divertor, Inconel-718 and 316L stainless steel for blanket modules, as well as vacuum vessel forging samples. The experimental results discussed include high-resolution gamma spectrometry measurements and analysis conducted with the post-irradiated samples, of which there were 68 in total. These samples were exposed through different experimental campaigns, including deuterium, deuterium–tritium and tritium phases. Diagnostics that supported the analysis included 25 dosimetry foil-based neutron diagnostics and two ‘VERDI’ neutron spectrometry diagnostics. A further 12 samples for positron annihilation spectroscopy were also irradiated. The irradiation of all these samples took place in a long-term irradiation assembly located near the JET vacuum vessel. The post-irradiation analysis of the ITER material samples has yielded valuable insights into their material activation levels and radiation fields. Comparative assessments between experimental measurements and comprehensive neutronics simulations have demonstrated a significant level of agreement in this work, while also revealing some discrepancies in specific material instances. The data and interpretation from this work not only serve as a robust experimental foundation for enhancing the precision and predictability of neutronics simulation approaches for ITER and next-step devices but also present some opportunities for the refinement of simulation methodologies. In light of these findings, a series of recommendations have been proposed, aimed at improving confidence in nuclear predictions associated with materials that have been exposed to fusion nuclear environments and advancing understanding in this important domain.},

The properties of planar electrostatic waves are fully determined by the plasma conditions, such as density, temperature, ionization state, or details of the distribution functions. Here we demonstrate that electrostatic wave packets structured with space-time correlations can have properties that are independent of the plasma conditions. For instance, an appropriately structured electrostatic wave packet can travel at any group velocity, even backward with respect to its phase fronts, while maintaining a localized energy density. These linear, propagation-invariant wave packets can be constructed with or without orbital angular momentum by superposing natural modes of the plasma and can be ponderomotively excited by space-time structured laser pulses like the flying focus.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the interaction between kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) and magnetic islands in solar corona region. KAWs and magnetic islands are believed to be one of the key players in the heating of the coronal plasma and particle acceleration. We have used the dynamical model for KAWs to simulate its propagation through magnetic islands. The equation is solved numerically by using the finite difference and pseudospectral technique for spatial and temporal variations. The simulation results have been studied and signatures of turbulent structures evolving with time have been observed. Turbulence plays a considerable role in tapping out magnetic energy to thermal energy. The plot of the energy spectrum as a function of wavenumber exhibits a power law behavior in the inertial range, characterized with an exponent around . Beyond this range, the spectrum becomes steeper. In order to gain a more thorough knowledge of the physical processes that underlie the development of localized structures and to estimate the current sheet scale sizes, a semi-analytically model is also performed. The results indicate that the size of localized structures are comparable to ion gyro-radius, and different intensities of KAW further modify this length scale formed at different times. The purpose of the study is to acquire an understanding of the KAW propagation in magnetic islands and the way it contributes to the formation of turbulence and energy release in the solar corona. A comparative aspect of the non-linear interaction of 3D KAW with magnetic island and null point is also presented which shows that non-linear interaction of 3D KAW with null point, leads to rapid disorganization of the magnetic field and the creation of localized structures.},

Predictive simulations with the linear magnetohydrodynamic stability code CASTOR3D show a reduction of the critical pressure gradient by up to 30\%, in agreement with experimental observations. The analysis has been extended to experimental plasmas considering, for the first time, ion diamagnetic drift effects in realistic non-axisymmetric (3D) tokamak geometry. The 3D geometry in plasmas with edge localised modes (ELMs) increases the growth rate of edge instabilities compared to the axisymmetric case. Further reducing the edge pressure gradient eliminates the instabilities corresponding to an experiment with suppressed ELMs, reproducing the empirically observed threshold for ELM suppression. Our findings highlight the importance of predictions of the ELM occurrence in full 3D geometry for future tokamak devices with intentionally and unintentionally broken axisymmetry.},

Linearly, both positive and negative δ can exert a stabilizing influence, with substantial sensitivity to the radial wavenumber kx . Nonlinear fluxes are reduced at extreme δ in a trapped-electron-mode regime, whereas low-amplitude ion-temperature-gradient turbulence is boosted by large negative δ. Focusing on the former case, nonlinear fluxes exceed quasilinear ones at negative δ, a trend that reverses as δ {$>$} 0. A change in saturation efficiency is the cause of these features: the zonal-flow residual is boosted at δ {$>$} 0, reducing fluxes compared with the linear drive as δ is increased, and a shift towards larger zonal-flow scales occurs with increasing δ due to finite-kx modes weakening with δ.},

The growth rates of ITG mode are almost the same for H, D, and T plasmas, indicating a gyro-Bohm scaling of ion-mass dependence. The nonlinear electrostatic simulations show that the zonal flow breaks the radially elongated eigenmode structures and reduces the size of the turbulence eddies, which suppresses the turbulence and the ion heat transport in the LHD. The turbulence amplitude without the zonal flow is almost the same for H, D, and T plasmas, while it decreases with increasing ion mass of the hydrogen isotope when the zonal flow is present. The reduction of the turbulent transport with larger ion mass is mostly due to the enhancement of zonal flows by larger ion mass. The ion heat conductivity deviates from the gyro-Bohm scaling for both cases with and without the zonal flow.},

Although results from current gyrokinetic computer simulations are in fair agreement with experimental results in core physics, crucial assumptions made in the derivation make it unreliable in regimes of higher fluctuations and stronger gradient, such as the tokamak edge. With our novel optimized and scalable semi-Lagrangian solver, we are able to simulate ion temperature gradient modes with the 6D kinetic model including the turbulent saturation. After thoroughly testing our simulation code against analytical computations and gyrokinetic simulations (with the gyrokinetic code GYRO), it has been possible to show first plasma properties that go beyond standard gyrokinetic simulations. This includes the explicit description of the complete perpendicular energy fluxes and the excitation of high-frequency waves (around the Larmor frequency) in the nonlinear saturation phase.},

Empirical modeling of SPARC plasmas with L-mode confinement indicates an ample window of breakeven (Q\,\&gt;\,1) without the need of H-mode operation. Extensive modeling of multi-channel (electron energy, ion energy, and electron particle) flux-matched conditions with the nonlinear CGYRO code for turbulent transport coupled to the macroscopic plasma evolution using PORTALS reveals that the maximum fusion performance to be attained will be highly dependent on the near-edge pressure. Stiff core transport conditions are found, particularly when fusion gain approaches unity, and predicted density peaking is found to be in line with empirical databases of particle source-free H-modes. Impurity optimization is identified as a potential avenue to increase fusion performance while enabling core-edge integration. Extensive validation of the quasilinear TGLF model builds confidence in reduced-model predictions. The implications of projecting L-mode performance to high-performance and burning-plasma devices is discussed, together with the importance of predicting edge conditions.},

The linear, nonlinear Alfvén modes, and the zonal flow dynamics are investigated, and their respective radial structures and saturation levels are reported. ITG dynamics in the presence of the zonal flows excited by these Alfvén modes are also investigated. The zonal flows forced-driven by Alfvén modes can significantly impact the ITG dynamics. A zonal flow amplitude scan reveals the existence of an inverse relation between the zonal flow amplitude and the ITG growth rate. These results indicate that forced-driven zonal flows can be an important indirect part of turbulence mitigation due to the injection of energetic particles.},

Capabilities around information visualization, data movement, and communication have all been enhanced. The level of capability deployed to remotely operate DIII-D required an infrastructure advancement over what had previously been achieved in the fusion community. The large quantity of real-time data that is automatically displayed on DIII-D’s control room screens can now be visualized by remote participants via web-based applications. New audio/video solutions using the VoIP and instant messaging application Discord have been implemented to mimic the dynamic and ad-hoc scientific conversations that are critical in successfully operating an experimental campaign. Discord’s ability for a user to rapidly move between audio channels, text with images, and share screens is a significant enhancement over traditional videoconferencing tools. In addition, multiple combinations of broadcast audio are made available via a web-based application to allow remote participants to simultaneously listen to general announcements/sounds while conducting their own specific conversations. Secure methodologies have been put into place to allow remote control of hardware including DIII-D’s plasma control system application. Secure methods also included the ability of the on-site team to closely coordinate their work with remote team members which has been enhanced through extensions to the wireless network and the use of tablet computers for audio/video/screen sharing. However, no amount of software can fully replace the need for ‘hands on hardware.’ This infrastructure was severely stress tested during the COVID-19 pandemic where occupancy of the DIII-D control room was restricted. Operational efficiency during the pandemic, measured in discharges per hour, remained high (3.8 ± 0.8) compared to values obtained pre-pandemic (3.7 ± 0.8).},

Detached divertor conditions will be required in future devices to mitigate divertor heat fluxes. Access to dissipative divertor conditions was investigated via an increase in upstream density. Detachment onset at the outer strike point was achieved with H-mode level confinement and reactor-relevant normalized pressures . Confinement degradation was observed with deeper detachment, associated with the loss of an electron temperature pedestal. Differences in geometry, radial transport, impact of cross field drifts are discussed to explain differences in access to detachment in NT discharges. Higher normalized densities, with respect to equivalent discharges in positive triangularity, were necessary to achieve detachment, partially explained by the shorter parallel connection length to the targets. The effect of cross-field particle drifts (E×B, B B) on access to detachment was demonstrated by the lower upstream density needed to access detachment with ion B B drift directed outside of the active divertor (Greenwald fraction 0.9–1.0 vs 1.3). The upstream density at detachment onset was observed to increase linearly with plasma current with ion B B drift into the divertor, consistent with the observed narrowing of the scrape-off layer heat flux width λ q . Edge fluid simulations capture separatrix densities needed to achieve detachment in NT plasma and their dependence on drift direction. The ability to reproduce detachment dynamics in NT plasma increases the confidence in future design studies for NT divertors.},

  abstract = {The high acquisition cost and the significant demand for disruptive discharges for data-driven disruption prediction models in future tokamaks pose an inherent contradiction in disruption prediction research. In this paper, we demonstrated a novel approach to predict disruption in a future tokamak using only a few discharges based on domain adaptation (DA). The approach aims to predict disruption by finding a feature space that is universal to all tokamaks. The first step is to use the existing understanding of physics to extract physics-guided features from the diagnostic signals of each tokamak, called physics-guided feature extraction (PGFE). The second step is to align a few data from the future tokamak (target domain) and a large amount of data from existing tokamaks (source domain) based on a DA algorithm called CORrelation ALignment (CORAL). It is the first attempt at applying DA in the cross-tokamak disruption prediction task. PGFE has been successfully applied in J-TEXT to predict disruption with excellent performance. PGFE can also reduce the data volume requirements due to extracting the less device-specific features, thereby establishing a solid foundation for cross-tokamak disruption prediction. We have further improved CORAL called supervised CORAL (S-CORAL) to enhance its appropriateness in feature alignment for the disruption prediction task. To simulate the existing and future tokamak case, we selected J-TEXT as the existing tokamak and EAST as the future tokamak, which has a large gap in the ranges of plasma parameters. The utilization of the S-CORAL improves the disruption prediction performance on future tokamak. Through interpretable analysis, we discovered that the learned knowledge of the disruption prediction model through this approach exhibits more similarities to the model trained on large data volumes of future tokamak. This approach provides a light, interpretable and few data-required ways by aligning features to predict disruption using small data volume from the future tokamak.},

  abstract = {Superconducting (SC) tokamak JT-60SA plays an essential role in fusion research and development by supporting and complementing the ITER project, providing directions to the DEMO design activity and fostering next generation scientists and engineers. Since the short circuit incident at the terminal joints of equilibrium field coil \#1 during the integrated commissioning (IC) in March 2021, both EU and JA implementing agencies (IAs) have examined how to ensure safe operation of JT-60SA by mitigating the risk of possible discharge occurrence inside the cryostat. Based on the experience of the global Paschen tests, the IAs have established a strategy of risk mitigation measures, which is a combination of (i) reinforcement of insulation, (ii) avoiding unnecessary voltage application to the coil systems and (iii) immediate de-energization of the coils when deteriorated vacuum conditions are detected. Thanks to the considerable efforts of the Integrated Project Team members, the IC restarted in May 2023. After confirmation of the SC state of the coil systems (TF, EF and CS), the coil energization test and the plasma operation phase 1 (OP-1) started. The first plasma was successfully achieved on 23 October 2023 with a limited value of voltage and current applied to the coils. The plasma configuration control was also confirmed with low plasma current and low auxiliary heating power conditions. Based on the IO–F4E–QST collaboration, activities of JT-60SA have been shared with the IO and provided an important lesson for ITER assembly and commissioning, and will provide an outstanding contribution to fusion research at large. After OP-1, maintenance \& enhancement phase 1 (M/E-1) starts from January 2024, in which in-vessel components are installed, and heating and diagnostic systems are extensively upgraded to allow a high power heating experiment planned in OP-2. In order to make the best use of JT-60SA, a newly organized JT-60SA experiment team will refine the research plan for the future high heating power operation phase.},

  abstract = {This paper presents global gyrokinetic simulations on the transport time scale of an ASDEX Upgrade H-mode discharge showing a pronounced peaking of the on-axis ion temperature profiles. Leveraging the newly developed GENE-Tango tool, which combines the global gyrokinetic code GENE with the transport solver Tango, we investigate the impact of energetic particles and electromagnetic effects on the improved plasma performance observed in the experimental discharge. Our results reveal that a striking agreement between the GENE-Tango simulations and the experimental measurements can be achieved only when energetic particles and electromagnetic effects are simultaneously retained in the modeling. In contrast, when these are neglected we observed a significant underestimation of the on-axis ion temperature, aligning with profiles computed using TGLF-ASTRA. The peaking in the ion temperature profile observed in the simulations can be attributed to the effective suppression of turbulence by high-frequency electromagnetic modes, likely Kinetic Ballooning Modes/Alfvén eigenmodes. These modes play a critical role in enhancing zonal flow activity and shearing rate levels which thus lead to a localized increase in the temperature gradient. However, it is crucial to maintain these modes at a state of marginal stability or weak instability to prevent energetic particle turbulence destabilization. Otherwise, the result would be a flattening of all the thermal profiles. Interestingly, we found that global GENE-Tango simulations are required to model correctly the linear dynamics of these high-frequency modes. Additionally, global simulations demonstrate greater tolerance than flux-tube simulations for marginal instability of these high frequency modes while maintaining power balance agreement.},

  abstract = {The work reported in this paper addresses two aspects. In the first part, numerical simulations are conducted to examine the impact of magnetic equilibrium shaping (elongation and triangularity), on both conventional Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) modes and Short Wavelength ITG modes. This analysis is performed considering the experimental profiles and parameters of the ADITYA-U tokamak, employing the nonlinear global gyrokinetic Particle-in-Cell code ORB5. The linear and nonlinear collisionless electrostatic simulation of these modes are carried out with kinetic ions and adiabatic electrons. From the linear results, it has been observed that the magnetic equilibrium shaping slighty reduced the growth rates and widened the spectrum, and the maxima of growth rate curve is shifted to higher toroidal wave number. We find that the heat flux is reduced by a significant for the true circular magnetohydrodynamic magnetic equilibrium as compared to ad hoc concentric circular equilibrium reported in Singh et al (2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 086029). A further reduction in the heat flux is seen with magnetic equilibrium shaping. In the second part, linear collisionless electrostatic simulation studies of ITG coupled with fully kinetic electrons (both trapped and passing electrons are treated kinetically) using a drift-kinetic ordering is performed. It can be seen from the linear results that, in presence of kinetic electrons, the growth rate and real frequency of the ITG mode are increased significantly for ADITYA-U parameters and a mode propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction is identified at high toroidal wavenumbers.},

  abstract = {Experiments in DIII-D document the ITER Baseline Scenario (IBS) at q 95 ∼ 3 and P IN/P LH ∼ 1–2, in both deuterium and hydrogen utilizing Kr and Xe as Tungsten-equivalent radiators. The power threshold for H-mode operation (P LH) was determined experimentally without added impurities and found to be about a factor of two higher than the scaling law. In recent IBS experiments in deuterium, intrinsic levels of metals such as Tungsten (W) or molybdenum and inconel are present that reduce the pedestal pressure by 20\%–25\%. A complete radiative collapse of deuterium IBS plasmas occurs at W core concentrations C W = 10−5. Simulations show that for core temperatures expected for ITER, the plasmas would not have a radiative collapse at C W = 1 × 10−5, moreover Q = 8–10 would still be achieved for C W up to 3 × 10−5. In contrast to deuterium, the IBS in hydrogen is not affected by intrinsic high-Z impurities, indicating that hydrogen H-modes in ITER may not inform the D-T phase with respect to W accumulation and discharge survival. Compared to deuterium, the pedestal pressure in hydrogen is ∼25\% lower, with much higher ELM frequency of 150 Hz, decreasing with input power. Krypton was injected in a matrix scan of input power and impurity flow in IBS hydrogen discharges. Krypton impurity density profiles in hydrogen are similar to deuterium plasmas, but at Kr flows that are 2–3 times higher for the same input power. Krypton is transported into the core and affects the whole radius; at the highest injection rates a radiative collapse occurs at core radiation fractions of 0.3–0.35, consistent with the expected maximum W radiation fraction for ITER core plasmas. Comparing the results with previous International Tokamak Physics Activity database studies of the IBS confirms that at higher radiation fraction due to high-Z impurities, a drop in H 98 of {$>$}10\% is observed. On the other hand, the results using Kr as a W-equivalent radiator indicate that metal (W) devices at lower core temperatures than ITER may provide overly pessimistic performance extrapolations to ITER for deuterium-tritium operation. The new DIII-D results support a more attractive option for the ITER Research Plan with a short hydrogen phase for system commissioning, transitioning to deuterium operations as soon as possible to provide relevant conditions for deuterium-tritium operations.},

If the modes grow to large amplitudes, they can cause transport and redistribution of the fast ions, thus limiting fusion performance. To save computational resources, the resonant kinetic interaction between the fast-particle species and the modes is often modeled by MHD-kinetic hybrid codes. Here, we present such a hybrid model which is applicable to three-dimensional magnetic fields, accounts for a finite parallel electric field and multiple MHD modes present at the same time. The model extends the one previously implemented in the CKA-EUTERPE code allowing for a better estimate of the damping due to the parallel electric field and nonlinear mode-mode interaction. The capabilities of our model are illustrated by applying the code to model nonlinear frequency chirping and fast-ion profile flattening.},

  abstract = {Measurements of ion cyclotron emission (ICE) are obtained from most large magnetically confined fusion plasma experiments, and may be used in future to quantify properties of the fusion-born alpha-particle population in deuterium-tritium (DT) plasmas in ITER. ICE is driven by spatially localised, strongly non-Maxwellian, minority energetic ion populations which relax collectively under the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability. ICE spectral peaks are typically observed at, near, or separated by, integer harmonics of the energetic ion cyclotron frequency. Here, for the first time, we study how simulated ICE spectra from DT plasmas vary with tritium concentration and compare with an observed JET DT ICE spectrum. We incorporate a population of thermal tritons, in addition to thermal deuterons and an energetic minority population of fusion-born alpha-particles, in simulations with the kinetic particle-in-cell code EPOCH. This code has previously been used extensively for interpretation of ICE observations in terms of the self-consistent gyro-resolved collective Maxwell-Lorentz dynamics of tens of millions of simulation particles. Our simulation parameters are relevant to the ICE-generative outer midplane edge region of JET DT plasma 26 148, which included 11\% tritium. Quantifying the variation of simulated ICE power spectra with tritium concentration reveals that our simulation with 11\% tritium concentration most accurately represents the observed ICE spectrum from this plasma. This outcome is encouraging for the diagnostic application of ICE to fusion plasmas containing two thermal ion species, including future DT plasmas.},

  abstract = {The Eulerian variational formulation is presented to obtain governing equations of the electromagnetic turbulent gyrokinetic system. A local momentum balance in the system is derived from the invariance of the Lagrangian of the system under an arbitrary spatial coordinate transformation by extending the previous work [H. Sugama et al., Phys. Plasmas 28, 022312 (2021)]. Polarization and magnetization due to finite gyroradii and electromagnetic microturbulence are correctly described by the gyrokinetic Poisson equation and Ampère's law which are derived from the variational principle. Also shown is how the momentum balance is influenced by including collisions and external sources. Momentum transport due to collisions and turbulence is represented by a symmetric pressure tensor, which originates in a variational derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. The relations of the axisymmetry and quasi-axisymmetry of the toroidal background magnetic field to a conservation form of the local momentum balance equation are clarified. In addition, an ensemble-averaged total momentum balance equation is shown to take the conservation form even in the background field with no symmetry when a constraint condition representing the macroscopic Ampère's law is imposed on the background field. Using the WKB representation, the ensemble-averaged pressure tensor due to the microturbulence is expressed in detail and it is verified to reproduce the toroidal momentum transport derived in previous works for axisymmetric systems. The local momentum balance equation and the pressure tensor obtained in this work present a useful reference for elaborate gyrokinetic simulation studies of momentum transport processes.},

  abstract = {We report a variational formalism to calculate how much free energy can be released in a drift wave turbulence system, through which estimating the upper limit of the zonal flow intensity becomes possible. This formalism is rooted in the same structure between the wave kinetic equation and the particle kinetic equation, i.e., both following a Liouville equation. The minimal energy state is approached by rearranging the “quasi-particles” (i.e., wave packets) in their phase space. Taking the Charney–Hasegawa–Mima system as a prototype, we analytically derived an upper limit of the available free energy for a Gaussian initial distribution of the wave action. For more general scenarios, by developing an algorithm of rearrangement, we numerically calculated the available free energy. Through direct numerical simulations, it is further verified that the total energy of the zonal flow does not exceed the upper bound set by the variational principle.},

The PHA system is dedicated to providing information about the impurity content, and average along line-of-sight electron temperature in the plasma conditions. Moreover, it is also able to estimate impurity density and an average effective charge from the comparison of experimental spectra with the modeled ones. However, the experimental x-ray spectra can be interpreted in terms of interesting plasma parameters only when the theoretical radiation models first identify and then take into account all the relevant factors that affect the spectrum. Therefore, for this purpose, a theoretical model has been applied. Flexible Atomic Code, which allows for calculation of various atomic properties such as energy levels, cross sections for excitation and ionization by electron impact, transition probabilities for radiative transitions and autoionization, and any others as needed in the collisional–radiative approximation. The chosen spectra collected during the W7-X campaign (OP1.2b) were examined, trying to obtain an agreement between the observed and simulated spectra. The analysis carried out allowed for a reliable interpretation of experimental x-ray spectra, estimation of the electron temperature, and obtaining information on the content of tungsten impurities.},

TPDIs are found to occur regularly in the plasma edge due to wave trapping in density fluctuations for various confinement modes, and the frequencies of both observed daughter waves agree with modeling. Emissions from a cascade of subsequent decays, which indicate a generation of ion Bernstein waves, are correlated with fast-ion generation.

  abstract = {Negative triangularity (NT) is a potentially transformative configuration for tokamak-based fusion energy with its high-performance core, edge localized mode (ELM)-free edge, and low-field-side divertors that could readily scale to an integrated reactor solution. Previous NT work on the TCV and DIII-D tokamaks motivated the installation of graphite-tile armor on the low-field-side lower outer wall of DIII-D. A dedicated multiple-week experimental campaign was conducted to qualify the NT scenario for future reactors. During the DIII-D NT campaign, high confinement ( 1), high current ( 3), and high normalized pressure plasmas ( 2.5) were simultaneously attained in strongly NT-shaped discharges with average triangularity = −0.5 that were stably controlled. Experiments covered a wide range of DIII-D operational space (plasma current, toroidal field, electron density and pressure) and did not trigger an ELM in a single discharge as long as sufficiently strong NT was maintained; in contrast, to other high-performance ELM-suppression scenarios that have narrower operating windows. These strong NT plasmas had a lower outer divertor X-point shape and maintained a non-ELMing edge with an electron temperature pedestal, exceeding that of typical L-mode plasmas. Also, the following was achieved during the campaign: high normalized density (/ of at least 1.7), particle confinement comparable to energy confinement with , a detached divertor without impurity seeding, and a mantle radiation scenario using extrinsic impurities. These results are promising for a NT fusion pilot plant but further questions on confinement extrapolation and core-edge integration remain, which motivate future NT studies on DIII-D and beyond.},

  abstract = {While much about Alfvén eigenmode (AE) stability has been explored in previous and current tokamaks, open questions remain for future burning plasma experiments, especially regarding exact stability threshold conditions and related isotope effects; the latter, of course, requiring good knowledge of the plasma ion composition. In the JET tokamak, eight in-vessel antennas actively excite stable AEs, from which their frequencies, toroidal mode numbers, and net damping rates are assessed. The effective ion mass can also be inferred using measurements of the plasma density and magnetic geometry. Thousands of AE stability measurements have been collected by the Alfvén Eigenmode Active Diagnostic in hundreds of JET plasmas during the recent Hydrogen, Deuterium, Tritium, DT, and Helium-4 campaigns. In this novel AE stability database, spanning all four main ion species, damping is observed to decrease with increasing Hydrogenic mass, but increase for Helium, a trend consistent with radiative damping as the dominant damping mechanism. These data are important for confident predictions of AE stability in both non-nuclear (H/He) and nuclear (D/T) operations in future devices. In particular, if radiative damping plays a significant role in overall stability, some AEs could be more easily destabilized in D/T plasmas than their H/He reference pulses, even before considering fast ion and alpha particle drive. Active MHD spectroscopy is also employed on select HD, HT, and DT plasmas to infer the effective ion mass, thereby closing the loop on isotope analysis and demonstrating a complementary method to typical diagnosis of the isotope ratio.},

  abstract = {Divertor heat flux and its correlation with pedestal parameters within various small edge localized mode (ELM) regimes, including high beta poloidal, type-II and ELMs with negative triangularity H-modes were investigated in DIII-D. The parallel energy fluences of type-II and high beta poloidal small ELM regimes fall below the linear scaling with pedestal electron pressure for type-I ELMs put forward in Eich et al 2017 (Nucl. Mater. Energy 12 84–90). The negative triangularity of H-mode ELMs follow the Eich scaling for type-I ELMs. The parallel heat flux and total heat loads to the divertor were determined using high-time resolution infrared thermography, while pedestal parameters were obtained through self-consistent kinetic equilibrium reconstructions. Linear regressions for the type-II and high beta poloidal regimes demonstrate that an equivalent 7.5 MA small ELM scenario in ITER would fall below the 5 leading edge melting limit for tungsten (Gunn et al 2017 Nucl. Fusion 57 046025). Utilizing fast thermography, the scrape-off layer power fall-off length for both inter-ELM and intra-ELM was determined and compared to the Eich scaling with poloidal magnetic field in Eich et al (ASDEX Upgrade Team and JET EFDA Contributors 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 093031). Except for the high beta poloidal scenario, all the small ELM regimes during both inter- and intra-ELM periods had power fall-off lengths larger then would be expected from the scaling associated with type-I ELMs, signifying their potential in managing heat loads and offering a solution for core–edge integration.},

In all cases, the discharges undergo a transition to H-mode with accompanying edge-localized modes (ELMs) that are not explained by the peeling-ballooning stability analysis alone. A variation in the ion drift direction is observed. A lower pressure gradient, shallower radial electric field well and increased temperature fluctuations are measured in the favorable case. In addition, irregular ELMs are present. This difference is more pronounced in electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) plasmas compared to plasmas with combined neutral beam injection and ECRH. A comparative analysis between two discharges, featuring similar plasma parameters but varied shaping, suggests that an interplay between other parameters, such as magnetic shear, the timing of the auxiliary heating and shaping, might play a strong role in low- to high-confinement transitions. While the low shaping discharge maintained L-mode, the high shaping discharge entered H-mode with ELMs, contrary to expectations.},

  abstract = {The energy partition in high Mach number collisionless shock waves is central to a wide range of high-energy astrophysical environments. We present a new theoretical model for electron heating that accounts for the energy exchange between electrons and ions at the shock. The fundamental mechanism relies on the difference in inertia between electrons and ions, resulting in differential scattering of the particles off a decelerating magnetically dominated microturbulence across the shock transition. We show that the self-consistent interplay between the resulting ambipolar-type electric field and diffusive transport of electrons leads to efficient heating in the magnetic field produced by the Weibel instability in the high Mach number regime and is consistent with fully kinetic simulations.},

Sawtooth dynamics and its interaction with broadband plasma turbulence has been a challenge for predictive simulations of core transport in future fusion devices. This study provides new observations of core turbulence behavior during sawtooth oscillations in DIII-D hydrogen L-mode neutral beam injection heated plasmas in an inner wall limited configuration. A strong correlation of electron temperature and density turbulence levels with the sawtooth oscillation phase has been observed at locations inside the T e inversion radius and/or safety factor q = 1 magnetic surface. The T e turbulence amplitude in the core during the sawtooth ramp exhibits a critical T e gradient behavior inside but not near the T e inversion radius/q = 1 magnetic surface. The most unstable mode calculated from the trapped gyro-landau fluid turbulence simulations reveal a change from low-k ion-type to low-k electron-type modes from pre- to post- sawtooth crash time periods.},

  abstract = {The transition from small edge-localized modes (ELMs) to large ELMs has been repetitively observed in minute-scale long-pulse high-confinement mode (H-mode) discharges during the 2017 EAST campaign. The appearance of large ELMs is found to be strongly correlated with the decrease in separatrix density due to the gradual decrease in fuel recycling during long-pulse H-mode operations (LPHOs). By the numerical scanning of separatrix density with a fixed temperature profile, it has been found that the dependence of ELM instability on separatrix density is related to the competition between the ion diamagnetic stabilizing effect and destabilizing effect of pressure gradient and current density in the pedestal region. This sheds light on a comprehensive understanding of the different roles of separatrix density in ELM instability observed during EAST experiments. With a high separatrix density, the ideal ballooning mode can be destabilized near the separatrix, which is thought to help achieve small ELMs in EAST LPHOs. During the 2021 EAST campaign, an experiment of large ELM control was performed through actively changing fuel recycling by moving the strike point location on the lower tungsten divertor target plate. It has been demonstrated that the mitigation of large ELMs is strongly correlated with the significant increase in separatrix density, which is thought to be attributed to a higher ionization source in the scrape-off layer (SOL) region by SOLPS-ITER simulation. The high ionization source in the SOL region is believed to provide a strong fueling effect near the separatrix and thus raise the local density, which is considered an important reason for triggering ballooning instabilities near the separatrix and achieving small ELMs.},

This observation was made using a combination of soft x-ray imaging and electron cyclotron emission diagnostics. It was noted that the repetitive bursting of m/n\,=\,1/1 internal mode (large amplitude, short bursting duration) transitions into a long-lasting continuous one (small amplitude, constant frequency), when βp\&gt;\,2.2 in H-mode, a much shorter bursting duration, transitioning into a long-lasting continuous one, with smaller amplitude and a constant frequency. Conversely, for typical βp\&lt;\,1.5 in L/I discharge, the frequency of m/n\,=\,1/1 mode decreases with time, associated with local poloidal electron diamagnetism drift velocity. The benign m/n\,=\,1/1 mode in high βp has an amplitude much smaller than one in L-mode for high βP stabilization effect. By adjusting the power deposition of electron cyclotron resonance heating, it is found that the saturation level of m/n\,=\,1/1 mode is independent of the local electron temperature gradient in H-mode discharge. It underscores that the flat current and, hence, weak magnetic shear are crucial factors influencing the saturation level of the m/n\,=\,1/1 mode for both the off-axis electron cyclotron current driving current-dominant and off-axis bootstrap current-dominant cases. Furthermore, the outward movement with growth of the m/n\,=\,1/1 mode in the process of L-H mode transition and the characteristic time of this process are close to the current diffusion time.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium potential structure in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of the field-reversed configuration (FRC) can be affected by the penetration of edge biasing applied at the divertor ends. The primary focus of the paper is to establish a formulation that accurately captures both parallel and radial variations of the two-dimensional (2D) potential in SOL. The formulation mainly describes a quasi-neutral plasma with a logical sheath boundary. A full-f gyrokinetic ion model and a massless electron model are implemented in the GTC-X code to solve for the self-consistent equilibrium potential, given fixed radial potential profiles at the boundaries. The first essential point of this 2D model lies in its ability to couple radial and parallel dynamics stemming from resistive currents and drag force on ions. The model successfully recovers the fluid force balance and continuity equations. These collisional effects on 2D potential mainly appear through the density profile changes, modifying the potential through electron pressure gradient. This means an accurate prescription of electron density and temperature profiles is important in predicting the potential structure in the FRC SOL. The Debye sheath potential and the potential profiles applied at the boundaries can be additional factors contributing to the 2D variations in SOL. This comprehensive full-f scheme holds promise for future investigations into turbulent transport in the presence of the self-consistent 2D potential together with the non-Maxwellian distributions and open boundary conditions in the FRC SOL.},

An ideal approach to de-aliasing in the periodic dimension is the Fourier truncation. Finite difference low-pass filtering applied in the non-periodic direction strongly dampens aliasing modes. At the same time, it induces numerical dissipation in the region of the physically realistic solution. It is shown analytically that the long-wave dissipation coefficient is proportional to the ( Np−3) power of the wavenumber under desirable constraints satisfying the highest order of accuracy, where  Np is the number of filter points. Numerical results after applying the optimized low-pass filtering to the nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence simulation suggest that the nine-point format preserves intact mesoscopic zonal structures in tokamak plasma, and is therefore suitable for long-time nonlinear turbulence simulations.},

  abstract = {The role of a series of quasi-coherent modes (QCMs) on the turbulence properties has been investigated during Type-III ELMs under HL-2A high confinement mode (H-mode) scenarios. The QCMs are essentially electrostatic and appear during the inter-ELM periods, with a frequency ranging from 20 kHz to 60 kHz. These QCMs are localized in the pedestal region and are related to the saturation of density gradient in the pedestal. Nonlinear couplings between QCMs and ambient turbulence have been observed and also verified through the envelope modulation of turbulence in density by the radial electrical field fluctuation of the modes. The presence of QCMs can increase the radial and poloidal turbulence correlation lengths, thereby modulating the turbulent transport. Experimental results show that QCMs significantly impact pedestal turbulence and transport by increasing the correlation length as well as the decorrelation time of turbulent eddies. The flow shearing rate in pedestal region is also enhanced to a level that surpasses the decorrelation frequency of turbulence, thus, the existence of QCMs has the ability to put off the ELM burst due to relative stronger stabilization of turbulence by sheared flows. The above results have demonstrated that the pedestal dynamics is largely determined by the complex interactions among QCMs, turbulence and the shear flow.},

  abstract = {Experimental campaigns at the Joint European Torus with an ITER-like Be/W wall with pure deuterium (D), tritium (T), and deuterium–tritium (DT) were a unique opportunity to explore various aspects related to the ITER operation. One of the most important challenges in recent years was the development of the hybrid scenario for D-T, based on reference deuterium and tritium plasmas. This kind of scenario, one of the foreseen for ITER, is characterized by a low current plasma and a high normalized beta βN factor compared to the parallel optimized baseline scenario [Hobirk et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 54, 095001 (2012)]. As the experiments have shown, controlling the plasma edge in the different phases of the hybrid scenario becomes more difficult with higher isotope mass, and therefore, are also in risk of impurity accumulation [Hobirk et al., Nucl. Fusion 63, 112001 (2023)]. For this reason, investigation of the impurity behavior, as well as their control, constituted the crucial issue. The present contribution aims to compare mid-Z and high-Z impurities behavior within H-mode hybrid discharges in D and T plasmas, as well as D and DT plasmas. Detailed analysis shows that in the H-mode regime in the hybrid scenario, higher impurity radiation is observed for DT in comparison to D plasmas, as well as for T compared to D plasmas. Additionally, it was noticed that the most significant contribution to the plasma radiated power comes from W and to a lesser extent from Ni (∼10\%). Moreover, it was found that an earlier transition from small edge localized modes (ELMs) to ELM-free phase can result in the earlier increase in impurities.},

  abstract = {Cooling of the plasma edge is widely considered to be a key element in the density limit (DL) of tokamaks. This paper investigates the critical edge cooling threshold of the DL by exploring various plasma configurations in the joint-Texas experimental tokamak. Notably, significant differences in the edge electron temperature in the vicinity of the last closed flux surface were observed between the limiter and divertor configurations. However, the electron temperature drops to a similar level in the vicinity of q= 3 surface close to DL, independent of the magnetic field configuration. In addition, to evaluate the reliability of the critical edge cooling threshold, experiments were conducted by increasing the carbon impurity content to enhance the edge cooling rate. These experiments involved two approaches to increase the carbon impurity content: methane injection and penetration of a graphite solid source. Results from these experiments indicate that the temperature threshold of the q = 3 surfaces remains consistent even with a stronger edge cooling rate. The consistency observed in the electron temperature threshold near the q = 3 surface, regardless of magnetic configuration or edge cooling rate, could help refine existing theoretical and simulation works and improve the prediction accuracy of the DL disruption.},

  abstract = {Neoclassical transport in a non-isothermal plasma in which each plasma species has different equilibrium temperature is investigated by solving the drift kinetic equation with a Fokker–Planck (FP) collision operator in a circular tokamak model. Since it is known that a linearized FP operator does not have a self-adjoint property in a non-isothermal plasma, approximate models are developed for comparison to intend to have the self-adjoint property in the non-isothermal case. To achieve this, we set a common temperature that the system should reach after a long time, and the individual temperature of each particle species is expressed by a parameter to measure a shift of the individual temperature from the common one. Then, both the Vlasov part and the collision term of the kinetic equation are expanded around the common temperature, taking the temperature shift parameter up to the first order. It is found that the lowest order collision term of expansion preserves the self-adjointness while the first-order, nonlinear FP term does not. A large difference of the ion heat neoclassical transport is found in comparison between the developed models with and without the self-adjointness and the original FP collision term in the non-isothermal plasma, especially in a strong temperature equilibration regime, showing that a contribution of the collision term without the self-adjointness seems to be significant. Furthermore, when an impurity species is included, the result is complicated where the usual enhancement in the main ion particle transport coefficient, due to the impurity effect, is rather suppressed with the increase in the ion heat transport coefficients by the non-isothermal effects.},

The weakly negative magnetic shear is observed to be more stable for the ITG instability than strongly positive shear in this equilibrium configuration, primarily stemming from the scarcity of mode rational surfaces induced by the weak negative shear. This superiority in suppression for the negative shear persists in nonlinear turbulence with zonal flow artificially eliminated, where the emergence of turbulence solitons is observed and found associated with locally dense mode rational surfaces. However, the difference in transport levels among different magnetic shears diminishes in the presence of self-consistently generated zonal flow, accompanied by the disappearance of turbulence solitons. The nonlinear generation of zonal flow is found to be significantly affected by the magnetic shear. The study reveals a remarkable phenomenon that the Dimits shift no longer exists for negative magnetic shear, which is attributed to the weakness of the zonal flow generation near the ITG marginal stability.},

Plasmas 7, 3681–3690 (2000)]. While varying the plasma boundary triangularity, the TM stability is found to be dictated by the competing effects of the Shafranov shift induced stabilization and the bad-curvature induced destabilization. The negative triangularity shape increases the Shafranov shift (stabilizing) in the plasma core but also enlarges bad-curvature regions (destabilizing) near the plasma edge, with the net effect being largely destabilizing for the TM as compared to the positive triangularity counter-part. Large negative triangularity however can also lead to more stabilization for the plasma core-localized TM. Anisotropic thermal transport reduces the stabilizing effect on the TM associated with the favorable averaged curvature, resulting in more unstable core-localized TMs in both negative and positive triangularity plasmas. But the opposite effect can also take place for the edge-localized TM in finite-pressure plasmas with negative triangularity.},

Both the direct absorption of minority ions and the power transfer to bulk ions via collisions are considered, while also accounting for the edge effects on ion absorption near the core. The simulation results show that the appropriate scrape-off layer density profile and parallel wave number lead to enhanced edge coupling and broaden the absorption region with moderate absorption intensity of the minority ions, which is very important for ion heating. More power from the heated ions is transferred to bulk ions than to electrons through collisions in our simulation via optimization, and reducing the total RF power results in a significant increase of the absorbed fraction of bulk ions.},

Under the condition of a low toroidal magnetic field ( ∼ 1.6 T), the electron density ITB is the easiest to implement through the fueling effect of the first neutral beam injection with the least heating power. However, the ITB appears to be independent of heating power. The ion temperature ITB can be formed without reaching the threshold power under the condition of strong E × B shear flow, while maintaining ITBs in ion and electron channels simultaneously requires higher heating power. Moreover, the foot of the ITB formed in the strong E × B shear case is located outside that in the fishbone case, while the ITB strength remains almost unchanged. The fishbone activities do not always occur prior to ITB formation, as our previous results have shown, suggesting that there may be no direct relationship between the physical process of ITB triggering and fishbone activities.},

The dependence of the unstable AE spectrum in reversed magnetic shear plasmas on beam and thermal species is investigated in the current ramp by varying beam power in a sequence of discharges for fixed thermal and beam species at fixed density. In general, a spectrum of Reversed Shear Alfvén Eigenmodes (RSAEs) and Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmodes (TAEs) are driven unstable with sub-Alfvénic D beam injection while primarily only RSAEs are driven unstable for the H beam cases investigated. Further, for a given beam power, the driven AE amplitude is always reduced with H beams relative to D and for H thermal plasma relative to pure D or mixed D/H plasmas. Estimates of the fast ion stored energy combined with modeling using the hybrid kinetic-MHD code MEGA indicate that the dominant mechanism contributing to the difference between H and D beam drive is the faster classical slowing down of H beam ions relative to D and the resultant lower beam ion pressure. Calculations of the AE induced stored energy deficits using the reduced critical gradient model TGLFEP show quantitative agreement with the observed dependencies on injected power, isotope and minimum safety factor.},

We present first global turbulence simulations of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak edge and scrape-off layer in ITER baseline H-mode conditions. Reasonable agreement with the experiment is obtained for outboard mid-plane measurements of plasma density, electron and ion temperature, as well as the radial electric field. The radial heat transport is underpredicted by roughly 1/3. These results were obtained with the GRILLIX code implementing a transcollisional, electromagnetic, global drift-fluid plasma model, coupled to diffusive neutrals. The transcollisional extensions include neoclassical corrections for the ion viscosity, as well as either a Landau-fluid or free-streaming limited model for the parallel heat conduction. Electromagnetic fluctuations are found to play a critical role in H-mode conditions. We investigate the structure of the significant E × B flow shear, finding both neoclassical components as well as zonal flows. But unlike in L-mode, geodesic acoustic modes are not observed. The turbulence mode structure is mostly that of drift-Alfvén waves. However, in the upper part of the pedestal, it is very weak and overshadowed by neoclassical transport. At the pedestal foot, on the other hand, we find instead the (electromagnetic) kinetic ballooning mode, most clearly just inside the separatrix.

Machine learning based disruption predictors can exhibit impressive performance. However, their effectiveness is based on a substantial amount of training data. In future reactors, obtaining a substantial amount of disruption data in high performance regimes without risking damage to the machine is highly improbable. Using machine learning to develop disruption predictors on data from the low performance regime and transfer them to the high performance regime is an effective solution for a large reactor-sized tokamak like ITER and beyond. In this study, a number of models are trained using different subsets of data from the HL-2A tokamak experiment. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is executed on the models, revealing that there are different, even contradicting, patterns between different performance regimes. Thus, simply mixing data among different performance regimes will not yield optimal results. Based on this analysis, we propose an instance-based transfer learning technique which trains the model using a dataset generated with an optimized strategy. The strategy involves instance and feature selection based on the physics behind differences in high- and low-performance discharges, as revealed by SHAP model analysis. The TrAdaBoost technique significantly improved the model performance from 0.78 BA (balanced accuracy) to 0.86 BA with a few high-performance operation data.},

Nonetheless, the modes saturate nonlinearly at relatively low levels without triggering large-scale crashes, even though confinement degradation worsens as 𝛽 increases. In contrast, in an alternative configuration with nearly zero magnetic shear, ideal interchange modes induce a pressure crash at 𝛽=1\%. These results suggest that the standard W7-X configuration might have a soft 𝛽 limit that is fairly immune to major MHD events, which enhances the appeal of the stellarator approach to steady-state fusion reactors.},

  abstract = {The evolution of plasma profiles and radial electric fields in the edge of tokamaks during a transition to an improved confinement regime is explored in an unfavorable configuration based on self-consistent, flux-driven simulations of reduced Braginskii models with ion pressure dynamics. The edge plasma response to the heating power is explored by varying the heat source strength. The energy transfer from turbulent to mean flows is induced by the large-amplitude fluctuations as the power input becomes sufficiently strong. It is found that ion pressure fluctuations play an important role in the generation of the Reynolds power. Consequently, the plasma spontaneously forms radial electric fields localized at the edge, which reduces the radial correlation and amplitudes of edge fluctuations. An edge temperature pedestal also forms while the density profiles remain nearly unchanged, featuring an I-mode-like regime.},

Plasmas 29, 112303 (2022), utilized in the derivation of the kinetic equation for the intensity of turbulent fluctuations the assumption that the wave spectra are isotropic, that is, the ensemble-averaged magnetic field tensorial fluctuation intensity is given by the isotropic diagonal form,      ⟨ δ  B i δ  B j ⟩ k =   ⟨ δ  B 2 ⟩ k  δ  i j. However, it is more appropriate to describe the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence involving shear Alfvénic waves by modeling the turbulence spectrum as being anisotropic. That is, the tensorial fluctuation intensity should be different in diagonal elements across and along the direction of the wave vector,      ⟨ δ  B i δ  B j ⟩ k =   1  2 \,   ⟨ δ  B ⊥ 2 ⟩ k (  δ  i j −  k i  k j /  k 2 ) +   ⟨ δ  B ∥ 2 ⟩ k (  k i  k j /  k 2 ). In the present paper, we thus reformulate the weak magnetohydrodynamic turbulence theory under the assumption of anisotropy and work out the form of nonlinear wave kinetic equation.},

  abstract = {A weakly nonlinear theoretical model is established for the two-dimensional incompressible Rayleigh–Taylor–Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (RT–KHI). The evolution of the perturbation interface is analytically studied by the third-order solution of the planar RT–KHI induced by a single-mode surface perturbation. The difference between the weakly nonlinear growth for Rayleigh–Taylor instability (RTI), Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), and RT–KHI in plane geometry is discussed. The trend of bubble and spike amplitudes with the Atwood number and the Richardson number is discussed in detail. The bubble and spike amplitudes of RT–KHI change from the KHI case to the RTI case as the Richardson number increases. The deflecting distance of bubble and spike vertices becomes smaller compared to the KHI case as the Richardson number increases. The dependence of the nonlinear saturation amplitude of RT–KHI on the Atwood number, the Richardson number, and the initial perturbation is obtained. The Richardson number is as vital to the nonlinear saturation amplitude as the Atwood number. It is found that the variation of the nonlinear saturation amplitude with the Atwood number at different Richardson numbers is divided into three parts, namely, “RTI-like part,” “transition part,” and “KHI-like part.” In the transition part, the trend of the nonlinear saturation amplitude increasing with the Atwood number is completely opposite to the RTI and KHI cases. Finally, the theory is compared to the numerical simulation under identical initial conditions and displays good correspondence in the linear and weakly nonlinear stages.},
