  abstract = {We show that a class of near-marginal and low-collisional magnetised plasmas naturally evolve into a globally organised state dubbed the ‘ staircase’. A key signature of this self-organised state is the containment of avalanche activity, detrimental for confinement, by a series of microbarriers for transport, the staircase steps, beneficial for confinement. Conditions for existence of the staircase, impact on transport and confinement and robustness in parameter space are discussed.},

  abstract = {A detailed cross-verification between two global gyrokinetic codes, the core continuum code GENE and the edge particle-in-cell code XGC, for the linear and nonlinear simulations of ion-temperature-gradient modes is carried out. With the recent developments in the edge gyrokinetics, it may be feasible someday to describe the whole tokamak plasma on turbulence timescales using a coupled gyrokinetic simulation model. Before pursuing this, the core code (GENE) and the edge code (XGC) must be carefully benchmarked with each other. The present verification provides a solid basis for future code coupling research. Also included in the benchmarking is the global particle-in-cell code ORB5, to raise the confidence in the quality of the obtained results. An excellent agreement between all three codes is obtained. Furthermore, in order to facilitate a benchmark framework for other codes, we make a specific effort to provide all the relevant input parameters and precise details for each code.},
