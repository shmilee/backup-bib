  abstract = {The optimization of scenarios and design of real-time-control in tokamaks, especially for machines still in design phase, requires a comprehensive exploration of solutions to the Grad–Shafranov (GS) equation over a high-dimensional space of plasma and coil parameters. Emulators can bypass the numerical issues in the GS equation, if a large enough library of equilibria is available. We train an ensemble of neural networks to emulate the typical shape-control targets (separatrix at midplane, X-points, divertor strike point, flux expansion, and poloidal beta) as a function of plasma parameters and active coil currents for the range of plasma configurations relevant to spherical tokamaks with a super-X divertor, with percent-level accuracy. This allows a quick calculation of the classical-control shape matrices, potentially allowing real-time calculation at any point in a shot with submillisecond latency. We devise a hyperparameter sampler to select the optimal network architectures and quantify uncertainties on the model predictions. To generate the relevant training set, we devise a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to produce large libraries of forward Grad–Shafranov solutions without the need for user intervention. The algorithm promotes equilibria with desirable properties, while avoiding parameter combinations resulting in problematic profiles or numerical issues in the integration of the GS equation.},

  abstract = {In the edge of an L-mode tokamak plasma, particle transport and ion energy transport are shown to follow a strong microturbulence (SMT) scaling, whereas in the plasma core the transport is shown to follow quasilinear turbulence scaling. The dependence of diffusivity on potential fluctuation amplitude is linear in the SMT regime, and quadratic in the quasilinear regime. The transition to strong microturbulence results from larger E×B drift velocities in the edge compared to the plasma core. At these larger velocities, ions traverse the spatially correlated range faster than the stochastic evolution of the electric potential. Hence, these particles do not experience a time-stochastic field as required by the quasilinear approximation. Instead, scattering of particles in the SMT regime is caused by spatial stochasticity. In contrast, electron energy transport remains quasilinear due to decorrelations caused by collisions and fast parallel motion. Improved understanding of transport beyond quasilinear theory opens the path to more accurate modeling of transport in the tokamak plasma edge.},

  abstract = {The paper presents experimental and modelling results of a comparison of negative (NT) and positive (PT) triangularity ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) discharges using the plasma shapes presently foreseen in the DTT tokamak, under construction in Italy. This work is part of a broader effort of investigation to understand whether the good properties observed in NT scenarios in DIII-D and TCV may be extrapolated to the DTT device and more generally to DEMO future operations. The experimental results have shown a practical gain of running these AUG plasmas with only ECRH and mixed NBI+ECRH phases in negative triangularity, even if they access the H-mode. Indeed, the NT electron kinetic profiles recover in all cases the PT electron pressures inside mid-radius due to reduced transport in the region , while exhibiting lower individual ELM (Edge Localised Mode) energy losses. The ion pressure and expected fusion performance are comparable in the case of similar densities. Integrated modelling has been performed using the transport solver ASTRA and the quasi-linear turbulent model TGLF, investigating the transport properties of these discharges. The modelling reproduces the experiments qualitatively with reasonable accuracy. Nonetheless, the heat transport in NT cases is partially overestimated. This may be because TGLF uses the Miller equilibrium, which approximates the magnetic flux surfaces as up-down symmetric. In the caseof these asymmetric NT shapes, the simulated outer surfaces lose part of the tilt with respect to the z-axis, reducing the upper δ {$<$} 0 effect. A numerical test to discern the impact of the geometry by symmetrically flipping the shape has shown a beneficial effect of the negative triangularity on heat transport.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the impact of aspect ratio (the ratio of major radius R 0 to minor radius r) on the confinement benefits of negative triangularity (NT) plasma shaping. We use high-fidelity flux tube gyrokinetic GENE simulations and consider several different scenarios: four of them inspired by TCV experimental data, a scenario inspired by DIII-D experimental data and a scenario expected in the new SMART spherical tokamak. The present study reveals a distinct and non-trivial dependence. NT improves confinement at any value of A for ITG turbulence, while for TEM turbulence confinement is improved only in the case of large and conventional aspect ratios. Additionally, through a detailed study of a large aspect ratio case with pure ITG drive, we develop an intuitive physical picture that explains the beneficial effect of NT at large and conventional aspect ratios. This picture does not hold in TEM-dominated regimes, where a complex synergistic effect of many factors is found. Finally, we performed the first linear gyrokinetic simulations of SMART, finding that both NT and PT scenarios are dominated by micro-tearing-mode (MTM) turbulence and that NT is more susceptible to MTMs at tight aspect ratio. However, a regime where ITG dominates can be found in SMART, and in this regime NT is more linearly stable.},

The linear stability index Δ′0, even for positive values, is not enough to describe the trigger of the mode as the stabilizing non-linear effects tend to prevent the growth of a mode below a certain width. First, an analysis on the contribution of the stabilizing effect of the curvature and the destabilizing effect of the bootstrap is done. Second, the work focuses on the role of the ion polarization current, a return current that flows parallel to the magnetic field due to the difference in the drift motion of the electrons and ions. This contribution is thought to play an important role in the onset of an island of width W, because it scales as 1/W3, making it a dominant term in the GRE when W is small. The assessment is carried out over a subset of pulses, producing interesting observations that were then generalized across the entire database, obtaining consistent results.},

Results from the simulation with zonal flows agree quantitatively, for the first time, with experimental measurements of the fishbone saturation amplitude and energetic particle transport. Moreover, the fishbone-induced zonal flows are likely responsible for the formation of an internal transport barrier that was observed after fishbone bursts in this DIII-D experiment. Finally, gyrokinetic simulations of a related ITER baseline scenario show that the fishbone induces insignificant energetic particle redistribution and may enable high performance scenarios in ITER burning plasma experiments.},

All the stationary operational boundary plasma studies and reactor designs have been performed under this assumption. However, there has been a long-standing suspicion that a stationary-operation tokamak plasma even without external MPs or edge localized modes (ELMs) activities may not have a stable closed separatrix surface, especially near the magnetic X-point. Here, the first gyrokinetic numerical observation is reported that the divertor separatrix surface, due to homoclinic tangles caused by intrinsic electromagnetic turbulence, is not a stable closed surface in a stationary operation phase even without MPs or ELMs. Unlike the MP- or ELM-driven homoclinic tangles that could cause deleterious effects to core confinement or divertor plates, it is found that the micro-turbulence driven homoclinic tangles could connect the divertor plasma to the pedestal plasma in a constructive way by broadening the divertor heat-exhaust footprint and weakening the pedestal slope to the ELM-safe direction. Micro-turbulent homoclinic tangles can open a new research direction in understanding and controlling these two most troublesome and non-locally connected edge-plasma issues in a tokamak fusion reactor.},

In the edge plasma region, this transport takes the form of long filaments stretched along the magnetic field lines. Understanding the dynamics of these filaments, referred to as blobs, is crucial for predicting and controlling their impact on reactor performance. To achieve this, highly resolved passive fast camera measurements have been conducted on the COMPASS tokamak. These measurements are analyzed using both conventional tracking methods and a custom-developed machine-learning approach designed to characterize more particularly the mutual interactions between filaments. Our findings demonstrate that up to 18\% of blobs exhibit mutual interactions in the investigated area close to the separatrix, at the border between confined and nonconfined plasma. Notably, we present direct observations and radial dependence of blob coalescence and splitting, rapid reversals in the propagation direction of the blob, as well as their dependence on the radial position. The comparison between observations realized with passive and gas puff imaging does not evidence any significant bias due to the use of the latter technique.},

  abstract = {To sustain good lower hybrid wave (LHW)–plasma coupling for long-pulse plasma operation, for the first time, coupling feedback control is designed and realized in EAST using a proportion integration differentiation method by choosing the reflection coefficient (RC) of LHW power as the reference for gas-puffing feedback, and including one pulse test and multi-pulse experiments. Experiments show that such feedback control can work correctly and maintains good LHW–plasma coupling effectively for a long time, suggesting the possibility of feedback control application on LHW–plasma coupling in long-pulse plasma. Furthermore, during the feedback control process of multi-pulse supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI), the stored energy changes from 29 kJ to 58 kJ, and the energy confinement factor (H 89) increases from 0.98 to 1.45, implying a positive effect of coupling feedback on plasma performance. Experiments between SMBI puffing and the gas puffing system, fed by a piezoelectric valve near the antenna, are further investigated, showing that the response time of the RC with SMBI is faster than that by the piezoelectric valve. In addition, SMBI puffing on the electron-drift side of the LHW antenna is a little quicker than that on the ion-drift side. Studies suggest that such feedback control is effective for long-pulse LHW–plasma coupling, and the gas puffing by SMBI on the electron-drift side of the LHW antenna could offer an effective way to sustain good LHW coupling in steady-state operation in the future. Further optimization will be continued at a later date.},

  abstract = {Global linear electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations of micro-tearing modes (MTMs) growing in the wide pedestal of the ELM-free NSTX discharge \#132\,588 are reported. Two micro-tearing branches growing near the surfaces of safety factor q\,=\,4 (pedestal top) and q=5–6 (pedestal) are simulated. The frequencies of these MTMs with low toroidal mode number (n ranging from 3 to 6) are in agreement with the ones of quasi-coherent fluctuations present on the magnetic spectrogram. No kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) is observed at experimental values of β; instead, the experimental plasma lies 20\% below the critical global KBM threshold. This confirms local simulation results stating that experimental NSTX profiles lie in the KBM stability region. Carbon impurities, which are abundant in this plasma, were found to play a significant role. Neglecting them leads to a ∼50\% error in the growth rates.},

We report the first measurements of drift-Alfvén wave polarization in a hot, magnetically confined plasma. The breakthrough is enabled by a novel methodology developed from gyrokinetic theory, utilizing fluctuations of electron temperature and density. Analysis of data from the DIII-D tokamak reveals that the waves above the geodesic acoustic mode frequency exhibit dominant electromagnetic polarization, whereas lower-frequency waves show a mix of electromagnetic and electrostatic polarization, indicating a strong coupling between shear Alfvén waves and drift-acoustic waves.},

  abstract = {A quasilinear plasma transport theory that incorporates Fokker-Planck dynamical friction (drag) and pitch angle scattering is self-consistently derived from first principles for an isolated, marginally unstable mode resonating with an energetic minority species. It is found that drag fundamentally changes the structure of the wave-particle resonance, breaking its symmetry and leading to the shifting and splitting of resonance lines. In contrast, scattering broadens the resonance in a symmetric fashion. Comparison with fully nonlinear simulations shows that the proposed quasilinear system preserves the exact instability saturation amplitude and the corresponding particle redistribution of the fully nonlinear theory. Even in situations in which drag leads to a relatively small resonance shift, it still underpins major changes in the redistribution of resonant particles. This novel influence of drag is equally important in plasmas and gravitational systems. In fusion plasmas, the effects are especially pronounced for fast-ion-driven instabilities in tokamaks with low aspect ratio or negative triangularity, as evidenced by past observations. The same theory directly maps to the resonant dynamics of the rotating galactic bar and massive bodies in its orbit, providing new techniques for analyzing galactic dynamics.},

Perturbations to the core plasma can be reduced by a factor of 2 for equivalent edge stability proxies, while the perturbed plasma boundary geometry remains mostly resilient. The striated domain of perturbed field lines connecting from the main plasma (normalized poloidal flux ) to the divertor targets is found to be significantly larger than the expected heat load width in the absence of RMPs. This facilitates heat load spreading with peak values at an acceptable level below on the outer target already at moderate gas fueling and low Ne seeding for additional radiative dissipation of the of power into the scrape-off layer (SOL). On the inner target, however, re-attachment is predicted away from the equilibrium strike point due to increased upstream heat flux, higher downstream temperature and less efficient impurity radiation.},

In addition, the plasma in the kinetic simulations develops significant departures from thermal equilibrium, including pressure anisotropy that excites kinetic-scale instabilities, and a large field-aligned heat flux near the horizon that approaches the free-streaming value.

The resulting zonal flow states show a dependence on initial conditions and intermediate temporary changes of parameters, and feature characteristics of hysteresis, such as longer time scales for the decay of zonal flow states into turbulence than for the formation of flows out of turbulence.

The investigation is focused on the evaluation of the plasma triangularity (δ) impact on the impurity radiation in hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), tritium (T), and deuterium–tritium (DT) plasmas for pulses described in [P. A. Schneider, Nucl. Fusion 63, 112010 (2023)]. The variations of δ were in the range of 0.21–0.31 for different time windows with low magnetic toroidal field (    B t = 1.7\,T) and plasma current (    I p = 1.4\,MA) in the corner–corner configuration, that is with both the inner and outer strike points on the horizontal W-coated divertor target plates. The results confirm the rise in Be flux with plasma isotope and lower δ leading to higher plasma density close to the plasma wall. The dominant role of W as a source of plasma radiation has also been confirmed. For mid-Z impurities and W, the variations in their densities due to δ change are negligible and the rise in their densities is observed with higher isotope mass, although this effect is often masked by the dominant role of ELM frequency on the impurity level. The impurity radiation losses based on bolometry together with the W intensity are ruled by the changes in the electron density and are well correlated when the Te profiles are conserved.},

  abstract = {In the ITER and future fusion devices, W/Cu monoblocks will be used as divertor target which are exposed to both steady state heat load and transient heat flux. Especially, the transient heat flux up to 10 GW m−2 during plasma disruption, is expected to induce the shallow surface damages, such as melting, and even boiling of W/Cu monoblocks. Thus, the performance of damaged W/Cu monoblocks under subsequent long-term plasma discharges is a key concern that needs to be verified and tested on existing tokamaks. Since 2022, a new type of main limiter composed of ITER-like W/Cu monoblocks has been installed and tested in EAST. The surface of W/Cu monoblocks of the limiter was damaged by the transient heat flux during the early stages of plasma construction. Subsequently, they were subjected to long-term plasma discharges over 2600 shots in normal plasma discharge conditions. This circumstance conveniently facilitates the discussion of the performance of W/Cu monoblocks with damaged surfaces especially a melting edge with hill structure under prolonged exposure to plasma. In general, the shallow damage resulting from transient heat flux on W/Cu monoblocks appears to have minimal impact on the heat exhaust capacity under steady-state heat loads, as indicated by both experimental monitoring and numerical simulation results. However, shallow melting, leading to a change in surface structure and the formation of hills, could theoretically increase local temperatures, creating potential hot spots. This phenomenon requires further validation through dedicated experiments. Moreover, the brittleness of the near-surface layer may give rise to brittle destructions, such as cracks and even dust particles, posing an additional concern. These findings yield unique qualitative conclusions that can be referenced for ITER and other fusion devices.},

Plasmas 29 062501)) and application of simple formulas for electron heat transport from electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven turbulence in the pedestal. The formulas are improved by (1) improving the parameterization for certain key parameters and (2) carefully accounting for the impact of geometry and shaping in the underlying gyrokinetic simulation database. Comparisons with nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of ETG transport in the MAST pedestal demonstrate the model’s applicability to spherical tokamaks in addition to standard aspect ratio tokamaks. We identify bounds for model applicability: the model is accurate in the steep gradient region, where the ETG turbulence is largely slab-like, but accuracy decreases as the temperature gradient becomes weaker in the pedestal top. We use the formula to model the electron temperature profile in the pedestal for four experimental scenarios while extensively varying input parameters to represent uncertainties. In all cases, the predicted electron temperature profile exhibits extreme sensitivity to separatrix temperature and density, which has implications for core-edge integration. The model reproduces the electron temperature profile for high scenarios but not for low η e scenarios in which microtearing modes (MTMs) have been identified. We develop a proof-of-concept model for MTM transport and explore the relative roles of ETG and MTM in setting the electron temperature profile.},

By utilizing both 1D plasma profiles (current density, pressure gradient, and safety factor) and 0D parameters (plasma geometry, total current, and toroidal mode number), the model predicts linear growth rate of edge-localized ideal MHD instability in a given equilibrium state. By enabling the prediction of each instability within a second, the model reduces the time required for plotting a pedestal P–B stability diagram ( diagram) from approximately 100 CPU hours to a few CPU minutes. Notably, even with the utilization of parametric pressure and current profiles and plasma boundary shapes for the training dataset, the model shows a satisfactory level of performance in benchmarking the diagram for the reconstructed equilibrium from a KSTAR tokamak experiment.

  abstract = {A record duration of a 310 s H-mode plasma (H98y2 ∼ 1.3, ne/nGW ∼ 0.7, fBS \&gt; 50\%) has been recently achieved on experimental advanced superconducting tokamak (EAST) with metal walls, exploiting the device's improved long-pulse capabilities. The experiment demonstrates good control of tungsten concentration, core/edge MHD stability, and particle and heat exhaust with an ITER-like tungsten divertor and zero injected torque, establishing a milestone on the path to steady-state long-pulse high-performance scenarios in support of ITER and CFETR. Important synergistic effects are leveraged toward this result, which relies purely on radio frequency (RF) powers for heating and current drive (H\&CD). On-axis electron cyclotron heating enhances the H\&CD efficiency from lower hybrid wave injection, increasing confinement quality and enabling fully non-inductive operation at high density (ne/nGW ∼ 70\%) and high poloidal beta (βP ∼ 2.5). A small-amplitude grassy edge localized mode regime facilitates the RF power coupling to the H-mode edge and reduces divertor sputtering/erosion. The high energy confinement quality (H98y2 ∼ 1.3) is achieved with the experimental and simulated results pointing to the strong effect of Shafranov shift on turbulence. Transport analysis suggests that trapped electron modes dominate in the core region during the record discharge. The detailed physics processes (RF synergy, core-edge integration, confinement properties, etc.) of the steady-state operation will be illustrated in the content. In the future, EAST will aim at accessing more relevant dimensionless parameters to develop long-pulse high-performance plasma toward ITER and CFETR steady-state advanced operation.},

  abstract = {A higher plasma β is desirable for realizing high performance fusion reactor, in fact, one of the three goals of JT-60SA project is to achieve a high-β regime. We investigate key physical processes that regulate the β dependence of turbulent transport in L-mode plasmas by means of both local and global gyrokinetic simulations. From local simulations, we found that the turbulent transport does not decrease as β increases, because the electromagnetic stabilizing effect is canceled out by the increase of the Shafranov shift. This influence of the Shafranov shift is suppressed when the magnetic shear is weak, and thus the electromagnetic stabilization is prominent in weak shear plasmas, suggesting an advantage of weak magnetic shear plasmas for achieving a high-β regime. In high β regime, local gyrokinetic simulations are suffered from the non-saturation of turbulence level. In global simulations, by contrast, the electromagnetic turbulence gets saturated by the entropy advection in the radial direction to avoid the zonal flow erosion due to magnetic fluctuations. This breakthrough enables us to explore turbulent transport at a higher β regime by gyrokinetic simulations.},

Tritium (T) and deuterium–tritium (D–T) operations present challenges not encountered in present day tokamaks (Horton et al 2016 Fusion Eng. Des. 109–111 925–36). This contribution focuses on ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) operations in tritium and deuterium–tritium plasmas, starting with a summary of the program of improvements to the ICRH system which spanned a few years prior to these experiments. Procedures were implemented to address specific constraints from tritium and deuterium–tritium operations (tritium safety and reduced access to the RF generator area) and increase the system reliability and power availability during plasma pulses. Operation of the upgraded real time RF power control system that maximises the launched power while taking into account limitations from the system or antenna coupling is described. We also report on the result from dedicated pulses performed to assess the potential harmful impact of the 2nd harmonic tritium resonance in the plasma, close to the inner wall, when using the standard central hydrogen minority ICRH scheme. During DTE2, the ITER-like antenna was not used because water leaked from an in-vessel capacitor into the vessel on day-2 of the experimental campaign. The lessons learnt from this incident are highlighted. Finally, the ICRH plant adjustments required to safely perform ion cyclotron wall cleaning discharges are described.},

In this paper, we explore a method for solving the Grad–Shafranov equation by using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). For PINNs, we optimize neural networks by directly minimizing the residual of the partial differential equation as a loss function. We show that PINNs can accurately and effectively solve the Grad–Shafranov equation with several different boundary conditions, making it more flexible than traditional solvers. This method is flexible as it does not require any mesh and basis choice, thereby streamlining the computational process. We also explore the parameter space by varying the size of the model, the learning rate, and boundary conditions to map various tradeoffs such as between reconstruction error and computational speed. Additionally, we introduce a parameterized PINN framework, expanding the input space to include variables such as pressure, aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity in order to handle a broader range of plasma scenarios within a single network. Parameterized PINNs could be used in future work to solve inverse problems such as shape optimization.},

This work built a multi-dimensional geometric model to characterize HTO transport in the port cell, absorption/desorption, and diffusion in walls and discussed the effect of paint thickness, ventilation rate, source term, and epoxy properties on detritiation efficiency. The results suggest that a 0.1–0.16 mm paint with the lowest HTO solubility is optimal from the compromise between quick cleanup and tritiated waste decommission. A higher ventilation rate could accelerate detritiation while minimizing the radioactive source by a tritium-resisting layer is the most direct method. The optimized design options for reducing the time required to reach 1 DAC in 12 h still need further discussion because of the delayed HTO source from epoxy paint and dead zone of the flow field.},

BES-ELMnet achieves the gradually increasing ELM onset probabilities between two consecutive ELMs during the inter-ELM phases and can forecast the first ELM onsets which occur after the high confinement mode transition. We further investigate the network generality in terms of the selected frequency band to ensure the use of BES-ELMnet for various operation regimes without changing the trained architecture.

It is shown that the L-H transition can then be initiated from an inner edge near the ITG-RBM transition point with a finite width. Especially, this width is found to have a strong edge safety-factor or poloidal field dependence, similar to that shown by the EPED1 model. Meanwhile, unlike the pedestal width, the H-mode threshold power appears to be much less sensitive to the edge safety-factor, in qualitative agreement with the observed weak dependence of the threshold power on plasma current (IP). From an additional brief check, these dependences on IP are also found to be quite different from the behavior of other parameters (ion mass, toroidal field, plasma density, and effective Z-number) where the threshold power depends relatively strongly while the initial width depends somewhat weakly on most of them, except the effective Z-number.},

The relatively high value of the Hurst exponent, which is a signature of avalanches, depends on the total heating power. On the other hand, the electron and ion heat avalanches measured in JT-60U tend to spread from the local peak of the temperature gradient and are not influenced by the heating source profiles. The contrasting features of avalanches in stellarator/heliotrons and tokamaks potentially imply the difference in the temperature profile formation, such as the presence of stiffness.},

  abstract = {The fusion-born alpha particle heating in magnetically confined fusion machines is a high priority subject for studies. The self-heating of thermonuclear fusion plasma by alpha particles was observed in recent deuterium-tritium (D−T) experiments on the joint European torus. This observation was possible by conducting so-called “afterglow” experiments where transient high fusion yield was achieved with neutral beam injection as the only external heating source, and then termination of the heating at peak performance. This allowed the first direct evidence for electron heating of plasmas by fusion-born alphas to be obtained. Interpretive transport modeling of the relevant D−T and reference deuterium discharges is consistent with the alpha particle heating observation.},

For example, the net effect of a wave–particle interaction may consist of moving populations of particles from one region of phase space to another. Different phenomena drive rearrangements that obey different rules. When those rules can be specified, it is possible to calculate bounds that limit the possible effects the rearrangement could have (such as limits on how much energy can be extracted from the particles). This leads to two problems. The first is to understand the mapping between the allowed class of rearrangements and the possible outcomes that these rearrangements can have on the overall distribution. The second is to understand which rules are appropriate for which physical systems. There has been recent progress on both fronts, but a variety of interesting questions remain unanswered.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of heavy impurities in the tokamak core is detrimental for its performance and can lead to disruption of the plasma. In small to medium-sized tokamaks the effective neoclassical transport in the pedestal is typically oriented radially inward. In larger tokamaks—e.g., ITER—where the temperature gradient is higher and density gradients are lower due to the need to operate in a radiative divertor regime, the neoclassical transport is predicted to be outwards. The models are derived for axisymmetric quasi-steady-state plasmas. Applied 3D magnetic fields, i.e., Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMPs) as they are used to suppress Edge Localized Modes (ELMs), have experimentally been observed in AUG to enhance the outflow of heavy impurities in the pedestal. There is no model that can predict neoclassical heavy impurity transport in these ergodized 3D magnetic fields self-consistently. In this contribution, we present our kinetic tungsten transport simulation for an ASDEX Upgrade plasma with applied RMPs. Our model based on Hoelzl et al. [Nucl. Fusion 61, 065001 (2021)], van Vugt et al. [Phys. Plasmas 26, 042508 (2019)], and Korving et al. [Phys. Plasmas 30, 042509 (2023)] utilizes a full-orbit pusher, ionization, recombination, effective line, and continuum radiation and neoclassical collisions with the background plasma. The effective collisional radiative rates are from the OpenADAS database, the neoclassical collision operator uses the framework of Homma et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 250, 206–223 (2013)] and Homma et al. [Nucl. Fusion 56, 036009 (2016)]. We show that the adopted collision operator produces neoclassical transport within a satisfactory degree of accuracy. A sufficiently high RMP current causes an increase in tungsten diffusion in the pedestal by a factor of 2. We compare the average radial transport between axisymmetric and 3D RMP scenarios in the pedestal region. RMPs enhance the pedestal permeability for impurities, which results in enhanced transport. In addition to the enhanced transport, some of W is found to be trapped in 3D potential wells in the scrape-off layer. Due to the lack of suitable diagnostics for W in the pedestal, we investigate and suggest that argon can be an adequate substitute in experiments for model validation and further understanding impurity transport in scenarios with applied 3D magnetic fields. With the newly developed neutral model [Korving et al., Phys. Plasmas 30, 042509 (2023)], we can combine the interaction in the divertor with the 3D RMPs to model the tungsten transport from the divertor toward the core of the plasma.},

In particular, it is shown that impurities can significantly facilitate an abrupt transient increase of fluctuation amplitude. To demonstrate this, a fluid model is derived to describe how impurities enter fluctuation dynamics. At the linear level, a wave similar to a drift wave can be excited in the presence of impurities. The nonlinear dynamics of this wave is formulated via modulational analysis, and it is demonstrated that drift waves with impurities can develop into a breather, a nonlinear wave that exhibits transient increase of amplitude. Our model indicates that nonlinear breathers become easier to be excited as impurity concentration increases. Breathers transiently increase fluctuation amplitude, and hence may be important to expel impurities. Implications on basic experiments and magnetic fusion are discussed as well.},

Density gradients, when large enough, lead to a violation of the constraint and hence preclude unstable modes and turbulent transport. This mechanism, then, broadens the class of configurations (in magnetized plasmas) where these high confinement states can be formed and sustained. The need for velocity shear, the conventional agent for TB formation, is obviated. The most important ramifications of the constraint is to permit a charting out of the domains conducive to TB formation and hence to optimally confined fusion worthy states; the detailed investigation is conducted through new analytic methods and extensive gyrokinetic simulations.},

By introducing the “associated” enstrophy, it is shown that with no FLR effects (where anomalous transport of all ion species is described as a transport of passive scalars in the turbulent fields of the electrostatic potential and electron density fluctuations) the fluctuating densities of ion species converge to the state where they are linearly proportional to electron density and vorticity fluctuations, which confirm previous numerical findings of [A. R. Knyazev and S. I. Krasheninnikov, Phys. Plasmas 31, 012502 (2024)]. However, in contrast to the “cold” ion approximation, with the FLR effects included, both the plasma turbulence and the dynamics of all ion species become interconnected. Therefore, for simplicity, the FLR effects in this work were considered only for a small “trace” impurity fraction. It is found that for light (neon) “trace” impurity, the FLR effects reduce both anomalous flux and density fluctuations. However, for heavy (tungsten) “trace” impurity, the FLR effects exhibit non-monotonic impact on anomalous transport.},

Our method remedies critical flaws of the two standard methods, reveals a previously unrecognized Gaussian-in-time-like decay, and can also account for an externally applied electric field. The Landau approximation involves deforming the Bromwich contour around the poles closest to the real axis due to the analytically continued dielectric function, finding the long-time behavior for a stable system: Landau damping. Jackson's generalization encircles all poles while sending the contour to infinity, assuming its contribution vanishes, which is not true in general. This gives incorrect solutions for physically reasonable configurations and can exhibit pathological behavior, of which we show examples. The van Kampen method expresses the solution for a stable equilibrium as a continuous superposition of waves, resulting in an opaque integral. Case's generalization includes unstable systems and predicts a decaying discrete mode for each growing discrete mode, an apparent contradiction to both the Jackson solution and ours. We show, without imposing additional constraints, that the decaying modes are never present in the time evolution due to an exact cancellation with part of the continuum. Our solution is free of integral expressions, is obtained using algebra and Laurent series expansions, does not rely on analytic continuations, and results in a correct asymptotically convergent form in the case of infinite sums. The analysis used can be readily applied in higher-dimensional, electromagnetic systems and also provides a new technique for evaluating certain inverse Laplace transforms.},

The fundamental properties of reconnection at kinetic scales, essential to understanding the general problem of reconnection in magnetized turbulence, remain largely unknown at present. Here, we present an application of the magnetic flux transport method that can accurately identify reconnection in turbulence to a three-dimensional simulation. Contrary to ideas that reconnection in turbulence would be patchy and unpredictable, highly extended reconnection X lines, on the same order of magnitude as the system size, form at kinetic scales. Extended X lines develop through bidirectional reconnection spreading. They satisfy critical balance characteristic of turbulence, which predicts the X-line extent at a given scale. These results present a picture of fundamentally extended reconnection in kinetic-scale turbulence.},

The causality analysis indicates that the regulation impact of poloidal flow on turbulent fluctuations and particle flux is weakened, while that of the toroidal rotation on the latter is strengthened by the RMP field. The impact of the changes in poloidal flow dominates over that of the modified toroidal flow on turbulent transport in the edge. The magnetic perturbation and the flows generally show predator–prey oscillations, where the causal effect between the former and the toroidal flow transits to a synchronization relation in the presence of RMP. In addition, the RMP field will weaken the causal effect on poloidal Reynolds stress while strengthening the parallel-radial component simultaneously.

  abstract = {Alfvénic modes in the current quench (CQ) stage of the tokamak disruption have been observed in experiments. In DIII-D the excitation of these modes is associated with the presence of high-energy runaway electrons (REs), and a strong mode excitation is often associated with the failure of RE plateau formation. In this work we present results of self-consistent kinetic-MHD simulations of RE-driven compressional Alfvén eigenmodes (CAEs) in DIII-D disruption scenarios, providing an explanation of the CQ modes. Simulation results reveal that high energy trapped REs can have resonance with the Alfvén mode through their toroidal precession motion, and the resonance frequency is proportional to the energy of REs. The mode frequencies and their relationship with the RE energy are consistent with experimental observations. The perturbed magnetic fields from the modes can lead to spatial diffusion of REs including the nonresonant passing ones, thus providing the theoretical basis for a potential approach for RE mitigation.},

In simulations focusing only on the ITG, electrostatic ITG drives a huge thermal ion heat transport, which is reduced by a factor of to a level close to the experimental value in electromagnetic simulation due to finite effect. In the simulations coupling the RSAE and ITG, ITG can scatter the resonant EP nonlinearly trapped by the RSAE and damp the zonal flows generated by the RSAE. The regulation of the RSAE by the ITG greatly reduces the initial saturation amplitude of the RSAE but increases the RSAE amplitude and associated EP transport to experimental levels in the quasi-steady state. The RSAE effects on the ITG, specifically the stronger zonal flows generated by the RSAE and the RSAE frequency modulation of the ITG-induced thermal ion heat transport, in turn, leads to a reduction of the thermal ion heat transport by more than a factor of . For a stronger background ITG, the regulation of the RSAE by the ITG is stronger, while the RSAE effects on the ITG are weaker. This work highlights the importance of cross-scale coupling in the dynamics of the AE turbulence and EP transport.},

  abstract = {The sputtering and transport of tungsten (W) impurities in helium (He) and deuterium (D) plasma discharges are compared using the SOLPS-ITER code. To reduce the computational resources of modeling, W ions are treated using the bundled charge state model. The results show that the W erosion flux of He plasma is almost a factor of two higher than that of D plasma under the same upstream electron density and heating power due to the higher W sputtering yield in He plasma. Moreover, the W self-sputtering flux is significantly higher than the W flux sputtered by the main ions. The leakage and retention of W impurities in the divertor region is also analyzed. W ions mainly escape from the near scrape-off layer (SOL) region through the divertor entrance as the stagnation point of the average W impurity poloidal velocity is considerably closer to the target plates in the near SOL region. Furthermore, the leakage flux of W ions in He plasma is higher than that in D plasma, mainly because of the higher W sputtering level in He plasma, which results in a larger W density. W ions with low-lying charge states, mostly comprising the charge state of W10–12+, easily escape from the divertor through the near SOL flux tubes in both D and He plasmas. In addition, the effects of upstream electron density on W sputtering and retention in He and D plasma discharges are presented.},

These studies demonstrate the relation of turbulence spreading and entrainment to intermittent convective density fluctuation events or bursts (i.e. blobs and holes). The non-diffusive character of turbulence spreading is thus elucidated. The turbulence spreading velocity (or mean jet velocity) manifests a linear correlation with the skewness of density fluctuations, and increases with the auto-correlation time of density fluctuations. Turbulence spreading by positive density fluctuations is outward, while spreading by negative density fluctuations is inward. The degree of symmetry breaking between outward propagating blobs and inward propagating holes increases with the amplitude of density fluctuations. Thus, blob-hole asymmetry emerges as crucial to turbulence spreading. These results highlight the important role of intermittent convective events in conveying the spreading of turbulence, and constitute a fundamental challenge to existing diffusive models of spreading.},

The use of tailored input and output layers to the neural network is shown to enable a PINN to learn the parametric solution to the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck equation in the absence of any synthetic or experimental data. As an explicit demonstration of the approach, the specific problem of Knudsen layer fusion yield reduction is treated. Here, the predictions from the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck PINN are used to provide a non-perturbative solution of the fast ion tail in the vicinity of the hot spot, thus allowing the spatial profile of the fusion reactivity to be evaluated for a range of collisionalities and hot spot conditions. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions of the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck PINN and the results from traditional numerical solvers with respect to both the energy and spatial distribution of fast ions and the fusion reactivity profile, demonstrating that the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck PINN provides an accurate and efficient means of determining the impact of Knudsen layer yield reduction across a broad range of plasma conditions.},

Tungsten (W) transport simulations are performed using the impurity transport code developed in the integrated code TASK. The geometric factors PA and PB are introduced into the neoclassical transport coefficients to include the effects of the toroidal rotation, which come from poloidal asymmetry in the high-Z impurity profiles. Inward neoclassical particle pinch driven by the main ion density gradient is enhanced by the poloidal asymmetry to be the dominant mechanism for W accumulation in the plasma central region. Simulations with experimental plasma profiles show good agreement with the experimental results and first-principle simulation results in the H-mode. In the hybrid mode and advanced mode, the impurity accumulation is enhanced in the internal transport barrier (ITB) regions. The condition to suppress impurity accumulation is investigated by calculating dependencies on the toroidal rotation velocity and ITB position. The neoclassical transport is sufficiently small with the prospected ITER condition of the Mach number of main ions Mi ∼ 0.1. The impurity transport inside the ITB is strongly influenced by competition between the density peaking effect and the temperature screening effect, and the present simulations show suppression of the impurity accumulation with the outer ITB position to improve the plasma performance, due to the relatively larger temperature gradient of the main ion.},

Both methods are applied to the magnetic geometry of the DIII-D tokamak, as well as the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarators, in the absence of temperature gradients. Here we analytically investigate the influence of collisions on the TEM eigenmode frequency by a perturbative approach in the response of trapped particles to the mode, using an energy-dependent Krook operator to model collisions. Although the resulting growth rates exceed perturbative thresholds, they reveal important qualitative dependencies: a geometry-dependent stabilization rate occurs for all wavenumbers at high collisionality, while at low collisionality, a geometry-sensitive mixture of collisionless, resonantly driven, and collisionally destabilized modes is found. Additionally, linear gyrokinetic simulations have been performed with a rigorous pitch-angle scattering operator for the same geometries. In the case of DIII-D and large wavenumber modes in HSX, the trends predicted by analytical theory are reproduced. Dissimilarities are, however, obtained in W7-X geometry and for low wavenumber modes in HSX, which are shown to be due to a collision-induced transition to the Universal Instability as the dominant instability at marginal collisionality.},

Reduced anisotropy of stored energy for energetic ion En⊥/Enǁ has resulted in an inward electron and impurity transport, forming a core electron density peaking. Increased anisotropy leads to a flat or hollowed electron density profile with an impurity exhaust in a core region [Yoshinuma et al., Nucl. Fusion 49, 062002 (2009)]. A high confinement state of particles in LHD has yet to be achieved, except for a temporal state of an electron density peaking created by a pellet injection. As a pioneering and crucial research result, the operation of energetic ion anisotropy by neutral beams has newly demonstrated that the direction of the radial transport of bulk and impurity ions can be controlled. At the same time, the overall plasma performance rises in neutron flux and stored energy. On the other hand, the increase in the anisotropy flattens the density profile. This new finding holds promise for a control knob of nuclear fusion reactors to enhance fusion power output.},

  abstract = {Based on a gyrokinetic analysis of and extrapolation from TCV discharges with large negative and positive triangularity δ, the potential of extreme in reducing turbulent transport is assessed. Linearly, both positive and negative δ can exert a stabilizing influence, with substantial sensitivity to the radial wavenumber kx . Nonlinear fluxes are reduced at extreme δ in a trapped-electron-mode regime, whereas low-amplitude ion-temperature-gradient turbulence is boosted by large negative δ. Focusing on the former case, nonlinear fluxes exceed quasilinear ones at negative δ, a trend that reverses as δ {$>$} 0. A change in saturation efficiency is the cause of these features: the zonal-flow residual is boosted at δ {$>$} 0, reducing fluxes compared with the linear drive as δ is increased, and a shift towards larger zonal-flow scales occurs with increasing δ due to finite-kx modes weakening with δ.},

  abstract = {With the increase in computational capabilities over the last few years, it becomes possible to simulate more and more complex and accurate physical models. Gyrokinetic theory has been introduced in the 1960s and 1970s in the need of describing a plasma with more accurate models than fluid equations but eliminating the complexity of the fast gyration about the magnetic field lines. Although results from current gyrokinetic computer simulations are in fair agreement with experimental results in core physics, crucial assumptions made in the derivation make it unreliable in regimes of higher fluctuations and stronger gradient, such as the tokamak edge. With our novel optimized and scalable semi-Lagrangian solver, we are able to simulate ion temperature gradient modes with the 6D kinetic model including the turbulent saturation. After thoroughly testing our simulation code against analytical computations and gyrokinetic simulations (with the gyrokinetic code GYRO), it has been possible to show first plasma properties that go beyond standard gyrokinetic simulations. This includes the explicit description of the complete perpendicular energy fluxes and the excitation of high-frequency waves (around the Larmor frequency) in the nonlinear saturation phase.},

Empirical modeling of SPARC plasmas with L-mode confinement indicates an ample window of breakeven (Q\,\&gt;\,1) without the need of H-mode operation. Extensive modeling of multi-channel (electron energy, ion energy, and electron particle) flux-matched conditions with the nonlinear CGYRO code for turbulent transport coupled to the macroscopic plasma evolution using PORTALS reveals that the maximum fusion performance to be attained will be highly dependent on the near-edge pressure. Stiff core transport conditions are found, particularly when fusion gain approaches unity, and predicted density peaking is found to be in line with empirical databases of particle source-free H-modes. Impurity optimization is identified as a potential avenue to increase fusion performance while enabling core-edge integration. Extensive validation of the quasilinear TGLF model builds confidence in reduced-model predictions. The implications of projecting L-mode performance to high-performance and burning-plasma devices is discussed, together with the importance of predicting edge conditions.},

Capabilities around information visualization, data movement, and communication have all been enhanced. The level of capability deployed to remotely operate DIII-D required an infrastructure advancement over what had previously been achieved in the fusion community. The large quantity of real-time data that is automatically displayed on DIII-D’s control room screens can now be visualized by remote participants via web-based applications. New audio/video solutions using the VoIP and instant messaging application Discord have been implemented to mimic the dynamic and ad-hoc scientific conversations that are critical in successfully operating an experimental campaign. Discord’s ability for a user to rapidly move between audio channels, text with images, and share screens is a significant enhancement over traditional videoconferencing tools. In addition, multiple combinations of broadcast audio are made available via a web-based application to allow remote participants to simultaneously listen to general announcements/sounds while conducting their own specific conversations. Secure methodologies have been put into place to allow remote control of hardware including DIII-D’s plasma control system application. Secure methods also included the ability of the on-site team to closely coordinate their work with remote team members which has been enhanced through extensions to the wireless network and the use of tablet computers for audio/video/screen sharing. However, no amount of software can fully replace the need for ‘hands on hardware.’ This infrastructure was severely stress tested during the COVID-19 pandemic where occupancy of the DIII-D control room was restricted. Operational efficiency during the pandemic, measured in discharges per hour, remained high (3.8 ± 0.8) compared to values obtained pre-pandemic (3.7 ± 0.8).},

  abstract = {The high acquisition cost and the significant demand for disruptive discharges for data-driven disruption prediction models in future tokamaks pose an inherent contradiction in disruption prediction research. In this paper, we demonstrated a novel approach to predict disruption in a future tokamak using only a few discharges based on domain adaptation (DA). The approach aims to predict disruption by finding a feature space that is universal to all tokamaks. The first step is to use the existing understanding of physics to extract physics-guided features from the diagnostic signals of each tokamak, called physics-guided feature extraction (PGFE). The second step is to align a few data from the future tokamak (target domain) and a large amount of data from existing tokamaks (source domain) based on a DA algorithm called CORrelation ALignment (CORAL). It is the first attempt at applying DA in the cross-tokamak disruption prediction task. PGFE has been successfully applied in J-TEXT to predict disruption with excellent performance. PGFE can also reduce the data volume requirements due to extracting the less device-specific features, thereby establishing a solid foundation for cross-tokamak disruption prediction. We have further improved CORAL called supervised CORAL (S-CORAL) to enhance its appropriateness in feature alignment for the disruption prediction task. To simulate the existing and future tokamak case, we selected J-TEXT as the existing tokamak and EAST as the future tokamak, which has a large gap in the ranges of plasma parameters. The utilization of the S-CORAL improves the disruption prediction performance on future tokamak. Through interpretable analysis, we discovered that the learned knowledge of the disruption prediction model through this approach exhibits more similarities to the model trained on large data volumes of future tokamak. This approach provides a light, interpretable and few data-required ways by aligning features to predict disruption using small data volume from the future tokamak.},

Leveraging the newly developed GENE-Tango tool, which combines the global gyrokinetic code GENE with the transport solver Tango, we investigate the impact of energetic particles and electromagnetic effects on the improved plasma performance observed in the experimental discharge. Our results reveal that a striking agreement between the GENE-Tango simulations and the experimental measurements can be achieved only when energetic particles and electromagnetic effects are simultaneously retained in the modeling. In contrast, when these are neglected we observed a significant underestimation of the on-axis ion temperature, aligning with profiles computed using TGLF-ASTRA. The peaking in the ion temperature profile observed in the simulations can be attributed to the effective suppression of turbulence by high-frequency electromagnetic modes, likely Kinetic Ballooning Modes/Alfvén eigenmodes. These modes play a critical role in enhancing zonal flow activity and shearing rate levels which thus lead to a localized increase in the temperature gradient. However, it is crucial to maintain these modes at a state of marginal stability or weak instability to prevent energetic particle turbulence destabilization. Otherwise, the result would be a flattening of all the thermal profiles. Interestingly, we found that global GENE-Tango simulations are required to model correctly the linear dynamics of these high-frequency modes. Additionally, global simulations demonstrate greater tolerance than flux-tube simulations for marginal instability of these high frequency modes while maintaining power balance agreement.},

  abstract = {The Eulerian variational formulation is presented to obtain governing equations of the electromagnetic turbulent gyrokinetic system. A local momentum balance in the system is derived from the invariance of the Lagrangian of the system under an arbitrary spatial coordinate transformation by extending the previous work [H. Sugama et al., Phys. Plasmas 28, 022312 (2021)]. Polarization and magnetization due to finite gyroradii and electromagnetic microturbulence are correctly described by the gyrokinetic Poisson equation and Ampère's law which are derived from the variational principle. Also shown is how the momentum balance is influenced by including collisions and external sources. Momentum transport due to collisions and turbulence is represented by a symmetric pressure tensor, which originates in a variational derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. The relations of the axisymmetry and quasi-axisymmetry of the toroidal background magnetic field to a conservation form of the local momentum balance equation are clarified. In addition, an ensemble-averaged total momentum balance equation is shown to take the conservation form even in the background field with no symmetry when a constraint condition representing the macroscopic Ampère's law is imposed on the background field. Using the WKB representation, the ensemble-averaged pressure tensor due to the microturbulence is expressed in detail and it is verified to reproduce the toroidal momentum transport derived in previous works for axisymmetric systems. The local momentum balance equation and the pressure tensor obtained in this work present a useful reference for elaborate gyrokinetic simulation studies of momentum transport processes.},

The PHA system is dedicated to providing information about the impurity content, and average along line-of-sight electron temperature in the plasma conditions. Moreover, it is also able to estimate impurity density and an average effective charge from the comparison of experimental spectra with the modeled ones. However, the experimental x-ray spectra can be interpreted in terms of interesting plasma parameters only when the theoretical radiation models first identify and then take into account all the relevant factors that affect the spectrum. Therefore, for this purpose, a theoretical model has been applied. Flexible Atomic Code, which allows for calculation of various atomic properties such as energy levels, cross sections for excitation and ionization by electron impact, transition probabilities for radiative transitions and autoionization, and any others as needed in the collisional–radiative approximation. The chosen spectra collected during the W7-X campaign (OP1.2b) were examined, trying to obtain an agreement between the observed and simulated spectra. The analysis carried out allowed for a reliable interpretation of experimental x-ray spectra, estimation of the electron temperature, and obtaining information on the content of tungsten impurities.},

TPDIs are found to occur regularly in the plasma edge due to wave trapping in density fluctuations for various confinement modes, and the frequencies of both observed daughter waves agree with modeling. Emissions from a cascade of subsequent decays, which indicate a generation of ion Bernstein waves, are correlated with fast-ion generation. This emphasizes the limitations of standard linear microwave propagation models and possibly paves the way for novel microwave applications in plasmas.},

The T e turbulence amplitude in the core during the sawtooth ramp exhibits a critical T e gradient behavior inside but not near the T e inversion radius/q = 1 magnetic surface.

  abstract = {The saturated internal kink mode with m/n\,=\,1/1 has been observed in the H-mode discharge of the experimental advanced superconducting tokamak, characterized by high \,βP and weak magnetic shear in the core. This observation was made using a combination of soft x-ray imaging and electron cyclotron emission diagnostics. It was noted that the repetitive bursting of m/n\,=\,1/1 internal mode (large amplitude, short bursting duration) transitions into a long-lasting continuous one (small amplitude, constant frequency), when βp\&gt;\,2.2 in H-mode, a much shorter bursting duration, transitioning into a long-lasting continuous one, with smaller amplitude and a constant frequency. Conversely, for typical βp\&lt;\,1.5 in L/I discharge, the frequency of m/n\,=\,1/1 mode decreases with time, associated with local poloidal electron diamagnetism drift velocity. The benign m/n\,=\,1/1 mode in high βp has an amplitude much smaller than one in L-mode for high βP stabilization effect. By adjusting the power deposition of electron cyclotron resonance heating, it is found that the saturation level of m/n\,=\,1/1 mode is independent of the local electron temperature gradient in H-mode discharge. It underscores that the flat current and, hence, weak magnetic shear are crucial factors influencing the saturation level of the m/n\,=\,1/1 mode for both the off-axis electron cyclotron current driving current-dominant and off-axis bootstrap current-dominant cases. Furthermore, the outward movement with growth of the m/n\,=\,1/1 mode in the process of L-H mode transition and the characteristic time of this process are close to the current diffusion time.},

  abstract = {Experimental campaigns at the Joint European Torus with an ITER-like Be/W wall with pure deuterium (D), tritium (T), and deuterium–tritium (DT) were a unique opportunity to explore various aspects related to the ITER operation. One of the most important challenges in recent years was the development of the hybrid scenario for D-T, based on reference deuterium and tritium plasmas. This kind of scenario, one of the foreseen for ITER, is characterized by a low current plasma and a high normalized beta βN factor compared to the parallel optimized baseline scenario [Hobirk et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 54, 095001 (2012)]. As the experiments have shown, controlling the plasma edge in the different phases of the hybrid scenario becomes more difficult with higher isotope mass, and therefore, are also in risk of impurity accumulation [Hobirk et al., Nucl. Fusion 63, 112001 (2023)]. For this reason, investigation of the impurity behavior, as well as their control, constituted the crucial issue. The present contribution aims to compare mid-Z and high-Z impurities behavior within H-mode hybrid discharges in D and T plasmas, as well as D and DT plasmas. Detailed analysis shows that in the H-mode regime in the hybrid scenario, higher impurity radiation is observed for DT in comparison to D plasmas, as well as for T compared to D plasmas. Additionally, it was noticed that the most significant contribution to the plasma radiated power comes from W and to a lesser extent from Ni (∼10\%). Moreover, it was found that an earlier transition from small edge localized modes (ELMs) to ELM-free phase can result in the earlier increase in impurities.},

This paper investigates the critical edge cooling threshold of the DL by exploring various plasma configurations in the joint-Texas experimental tokamak. Notably, significant differences in the edge electron temperature in the vicinity of the last closed flux surface were observed between the limiter and divertor configurations. However, the electron temperature drops to a similar level in the vicinity of q= 3 surface close to DL, independent of the magnetic field configuration. In addition, to evaluate the reliability of the critical edge cooling threshold, experiments were conducted by increasing the carbon impurity content to enhance the edge cooling rate. These experiments involved two approaches to increase the carbon impurity content: methane injection and penetration of a graphite solid source. Results from these experiments indicate that the temperature threshold of the q = 3 surfaces remains consistent even with a stronger edge cooling rate. The consistency observed in the electron temperature threshold near the q = 3 surface, regardless of magnetic configuration or edge cooling rate, could help refine existing theoretical and simulation works and improve the prediction accuracy of the DL disruption.},

Plasmas 7, 3681–3690 (2000)]. While varying the plasma boundary triangularity, the TM stability is found to be dictated by the competing effects of the Shafranov shift induced stabilization and the bad-curvature induced destabilization. The negative triangularity shape increases the Shafranov shift (stabilizing) in the plasma core but also enlarges bad-curvature regions (destabilizing) near the plasma edge, with the net effect being largely destabilizing for the TM as compared to the positive triangularity counter-part. Large negative triangularity however can also lead to more stabilization for the plasma core-localized TM. Anisotropic thermal transport reduces the stabilizing effect on the TM associated with the favorable averaged curvature, resulting in more unstable core-localized TMs in both negative and positive triangularity plasmas. But the opposite effect can also take place for the edge-localized TM in finite-pressure plasmas with negative triangularity.},

Both the direct absorption of minority ions and the power transfer to bulk ions via collisions are considered, while also accounting for the edge effects on ion absorption near the core. The simulation results show that the appropriate scrape-off layer density profile and parallel wave number lead to enhanced edge coupling and broaden the absorption region with moderate absorption intensity of the minority ions, which is very important for ion heating. More power from the heated ions is transferred to bulk ions than to electrons through collisions in our simulation via optimization, and reducing the total RF power results in a significant increase of the absorbed fraction of bulk ions.},

The dependence of the unstable AE spectrum in reversed magnetic shear plasmas on beam and thermal species is investigated in the current ramp by varying beam power in a sequence of discharges for fixed thermal and beam species at fixed density. In general, a spectrum of Reversed Shear Alfvén Eigenmodes (RSAEs) and Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmodes (TAEs) are driven unstable with sub-Alfvénic D beam injection while primarily only RSAEs are driven unstable for the H beam cases investigated. Further, for a given beam power, the driven AE amplitude is always reduced with H beams relative to D and for H thermal plasma relative to pure D or mixed D/H plasmas. Estimates of the fast ion stored energy combined with modeling using the hybrid kinetic-MHD code MEGA indicate that the dominant mechanism contributing to the difference between H and D beam drive is the faster classical slowing down of H beam ions relative to D and the resultant lower beam ion pressure. Calculations of the AE induced stored energy deficits using the reduced critical gradient model TGLFEP show quantitative agreement with the observed dependencies on injected power, isotope and minimum safety factor.},
